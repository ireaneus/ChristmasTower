The weary couple finally arrived in Bethlehem, only to find the town crowded with travelers. The narrow streets were bustling with people—families unloading their donkeys, merchants calling out their wares, and children weaving through the crowds with excitement. Every inn was full, and the warm glow of lanterns flickered in windows, signaling that all rooms were occupied. Joseph’s heart grew heavy as he searched desperately for shelter, knocking on door after door, but every place was already taken.

With no other choice, they left busy Bethlehem behind and ventured into the cold, quiet night. As they moved away from the bustling town, Joseph’s eyes caught the familiar outline of the *Tower of the Flock*, silhouetted against the starry sky. A soft glow spilled from the entrance, almost as if it were beckoning the couple to come and rest.
