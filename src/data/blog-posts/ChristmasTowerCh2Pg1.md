Years passed, and the tower watched over the fields and the lives of those who worked beneath its shadow. One day, it noticed a woman named Ruth, carefully gathering leftover grain after the harvest. Ruth was not from Bethlehem but from the land of Moab. After losing her husband, she chose to stay with her mother-in-law Naomi. With great courage she said, *“Where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God”* (Ruth 1:16, ESV).
