The story of *the Christmas Tower* had come full circle. It had seen the birth of the *Lamb of God*, and it had heard the voice of the *Good Shepherd* calling His sheep. Though the Tower itself may no longer stand, its story lives on—reminding us that God works through simple places and humble people to show His great love. And just as the shepherds once carried the *good news* of Jesus, we are invited to share it too, for the Savior who came that night still calls us to follow Him today.
