## Chapter 9 – The Tower’s Silent Testimony  

The ancient tower was unwavering, its stones weathered yet steadfast, holding the memories of all it had witnessed.  

It had seen Jacob’s sorrow turned to hope, Ruth’s redemption, David’s anointing, and Mary’s child born beneath its shadow. It had watched heaven’s angels proclaim good news, and now it stood as a reminder of the Good Shepherd who laid down His life for His sheep.  

Though the tower now lies in ruins, its story lives on. It reminds us that God often works through ordinary people and simple places to accomplish extraordinary things. Just as shepherds once carried the good news of Jesus, so are we invited to carry the same message today.  

He is our **strong tower**, our refuge, and our Redeemer.
