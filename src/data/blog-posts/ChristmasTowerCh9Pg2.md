Jesus continued to bless those who listened, saying:

> *“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven… Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied… Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God”*

> **Matthew 5:3, 6, 8, ESV**
