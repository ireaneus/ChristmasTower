## Chapter 3 – David the Anointed King  

The fields near *Migdal Eder* were peaceful as the tower continued its watch over the rolling hills of Bethlehem. Shepherds still tended their sheep beneath its shadow, just as they had for generations.  

Among them was a young shepherd boy named **David**, caring for his father’s flock. The tower had seen David many times before—his voice rising in song as he praised God, his hands guiding the flock, and his heart fearless as he defended the sheep from wild animals.  

Yet on this day, something extraordinary was about to happen. The prophet **Samuel** had been sent by God to visit David’s family. God had told Samuel that He had chosen a new king for Israel from among Jesse’s sons. One by one, Jesse’s older sons were presented to Samuel, but God did not choose any of them.
