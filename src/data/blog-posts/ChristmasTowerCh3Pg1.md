![David Sheep and Tower](/ChristmasTower/images/DavidSheepTower.webp)

The fields near Migdal Eder were quiet and calm, as the Tower kept its steadfast watch over the familiar rolling hills of Bethlehem. Shepherds tended their sheep below, just as they had for countless generations. Among them was a young shepherd boy named David. The Tower had observed David many times before—his voice often rising in song as he praised God, his hands skillfully guiding the flock, and his heart fearless as he defended the sheep from wild animals. Yet on this day, something seemed different.

On this day, something extraordinary was about to happen. The prophet Samuel had been sent by God to visit David’s family. God had told Samuel that He had chosen a new king for Israel from among Jesse’s sons. One by one, Jesse’s older sons were presented to Samuel, but God did not choose any of them. Finally, Samuel asked, *“Are all your sons here?” Jesse replied, “There remains yet the youngest, but behold, he is keeping the sheep”* (1 Samuel 16:11, ESV).
