> to whom God willed to make known what the wealth of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles is, the mystery that is Christ in you, the hope of glory.”

> **1 Timothy 3:16**
> “Beyond question, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was revealed in the flesh, was vindicated in the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.”

## Interpreting the Unclear by the Clear

> **Principle:**
> Scripture never contradicts itself. Therefore, **clear passages must govern our understanding of unclear or symbolic passages.**
>
> Example: Jesus explicitly states, “The one who has seen Me has seen the Father” (*John 14:9*). This clear truth anchors our understanding of Christ’s divine nature and visibility of God. Any unclear passage cannot contradict that revealed truth.
