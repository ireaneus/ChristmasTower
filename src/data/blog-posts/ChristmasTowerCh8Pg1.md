Without wasting a moment, the shepherds jumped to their feet. Their fear had turned into excitement and determination. They had been given an important message—a message of hope, joy, and peace for everyone.

*“We have to go!”* one of them said, his voice shaking with excitement. *“Let us go to Migdal Eder and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us”* **(Luke 2:15, ESV)**

They hurried across the fields, and as they approached the old Tower, its ancient stones seemed to glow faintly in the moonlight, as if the very ground around it was holy. They drew closer cautiously, their steps slow and reverent. Without saying a word, the shepherds took off their sandals, sensing they were standing on sacred ground.
