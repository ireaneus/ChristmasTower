As they neared the ancient tower, its stones gleamed faintly in the moonlight, standing tall and steadfast against the night sky. This was the place where lambs for sacrifice were raised, yet tonight it felt different—holy, as though the very ground was part of God’s story unfolding.  

They entered the humble shelter, and there, in the soft glow of lamplight, they saw Him—the baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger, just as the angel had said. A hush fell over them as awe and reverence filled their hearts.
