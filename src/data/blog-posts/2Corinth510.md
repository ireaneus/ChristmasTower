## The Judgment Seat of Christ

[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Last week's sermon focused on 2 Corinthians 5:10 and the theme of being **overcomers**. This verse also introduces a significant future event in the Christian’s eternal journey: the **Bema Seat**, or **Judgment Seat of Christ**.

## Q1. What is the Bema, or Judgment Seat?

[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Greek word *Bēma* (βῆμα) referred to a raised platform used by officials to pronounce verdicts or distribute rewards — often used in athletic and judicial settings.

### Key Scriptures

- **2 Corinthians 5:10**  
  *"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad."*

- **1 Corinthians 4:5**  
  *"Therefore do not go on passing judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes who will both bring to light the things hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of men’s hearts; and then each man’s praise will come to him from God."*

- **Romans 14:10**  
  *"But you, why do you judge your brother? ... For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God."*

> **Answer:** The Bema Seat is where believers are evaluated by Christ — not for salvation, but for reward — based on their faithfulness in life and ministry.

---

## Q2. What is NOT the Bema Seat?

[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The Bema Seat is **not** a judgment for sin.

### Key Scriptures

- **Romans 8:1–2**  
  *"Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus... For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death."*

> **Answer:** This is not the **Great White Throne Judgment** (Revelation 20:11–15). Sin was judged at the cross; the Bema Seat is for rewarding faithful service.

---

## Q3. What is the purpose of the Bema Seat?

[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Key Scriptures

- **1 Corinthians 3:12–15**  
  *"Each man’s work will become evident... the fire will test the quality of each man’s work... If it remains, he will receive a reward. If it is burned up, he will suffer loss — but he himself will be saved..."*

> **Answer:** The purpose is to assess the quality and motives of a believer’s deeds, to determine eternal rewards. It is not about entrance into heaven — that is already secured by faith in Christ.

---

## Q4. How do works relate to the Bema Seat judgment?

[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Salvation is by grace, not by works. However, **works reveal** the fruit of salvation and form the basis for reward.

### Key Scriptures

- **Ephesians 2:8–10**  
  *"For by grace you have been saved through faith... created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand..."*

- **James 2:20–26**  
  *"Faith without works is dead... Abraham was justified by works... faith was working with his works..."*

> **Answer:** Good works are the **evidence** of saving faith and will be evaluated for **reward** — not to determine salvation.

---

## Q5. How should this truth impact our daily lives?

[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Understanding the Bema Seat should instill urgency, endurance, and eternal focus in the believer's life.

### Key Scriptures

- **1 Corinthians 15:58**  
  *"Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain."*

- **James 5:7–9**  
  *"Be patient... strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near... the Judge is standing right at the door."*

- **Luke 14:12–14**  
  *"Invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind... for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous."*

> **Answer:** The Bema Seat reminds us that our lives matter for eternity — our faithfulness now has future reward. Live for Christ, invest in others, and endure with joy.

## Final Reminder
