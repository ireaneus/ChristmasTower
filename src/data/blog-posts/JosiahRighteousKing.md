> 1. *Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.*  
> 2. *He did right in the sight of the Lord and walked in all the way of his father David, nor did he turn aside to the right or to the left.*

## Devotional Thought

Josiah's zeal for righteousness wasn’t surface-level religion—it was deep, covenant-faithful obedience. He heard the Law and responded with humility and action. Like Josiah, Jesus too responded fully to the will of the Father, but He did so perfectly and completely. Josiah points us to a greater King, One who doesn't just reform behavior but transforms hearts.

Where Josiah reigned for a time, Jesus reigns forever.  
Where Josiah discovered the Book of the Law, Jesus fulfills it (Matthew 5:17).  
Where Josiah’s reforms delayed judgment, Jesus’ cross absorbed it.

## Application

- **Do I approach the Word of God with the same trembling reverence as Josiah?**
- **Am I removing the idols in my life the way Josiah cleansed the land?**
- **Have I responded not just with outward reform, but inward transformation through Christ?**

## Prayer

*Lord, give me a heart like Josiah’s—a heart that hears Your Word and responds in humility and obedience. But even more, give me a heart that sees Jesus, the true and better King, and bows before Him with worship and joy. Cleanse me from every false idol, and make me whole in Your righteousness. Amen.*
