## Chapter 7 – Heaven’s Song  

Before the shepherds could speak, the sky above them erupted into dazzling splendor as a multitude of angels appeared. Their voices soared in perfect harmony, filling the night with glorious praise:  

**“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom He is pleased!”** (Luke 2:14, ESV)  

The heavenly chorus rang out with power and beauty, echoing through the stillness of the fields. The shepherds stood frozen in awe, their hearts racing at the wonder of it all. And then, just as suddenly as they had appeared, the angels were gone, vanishing into the starry sky.  

The night returned to silence, but nothing would ever be the same again. The shepherds had witnessed heaven itself declaring that God’s promise had come true.
