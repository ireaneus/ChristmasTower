The "Five Solas" are foundational principles of the Protestant Reformation, firmly anchored in Scripture. As Paul said:

> **"For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures."**  
> — *1 Corinthians 15:3–4 (NASB2020)*

And so the Reformers proclaimed:

> **"We are saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, according to Scripture alone, to the glory of God alone."**

---

## 1. **Sola Scriptura (Scripture Alone)**

**The Bible is the supreme authority in all matters of faith and practice. It stands above church tradition and human opinion.**

> **2 Timothy 3:16–17**  
> *"All Scripture is inspired by God and beneficial for teaching, for rebuke, for correction, for training in righteousness;  
> so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work."*  
>
> **2 Peter 1:21**  
> *"for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God."*  
>
> **Isaiah 55:11**  
> *"So will My word be which goes out of My mouth;  
> It will not return to Me empty,  
> Without accomplishing what I desire,  
> And without succeeding in the purpose for which I sent it."*
>
> **Reformer Quote – Smalcald Articles (1537)**  
> *“In those things which concern the spoken, outward Word, we must firmly hold that God grants His Spirit … only through or with the preceding outward Word.”*

---

## 2. **Sola Fide (Faith Alone)**

**We are justified by faith alone—not by works. Faith is the instrument through which we receive Christ’s righteousness.**

> **Romans 1:17**  
> *"For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written: 'But the righteous one will live by faith.'"*  
>
> **Galatians 2:16**  
> *"…a person is not justified by works of the Law but through faith in Christ Jesus… since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified."*  
>
> **Ephesians 2:8–9**  
> *"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not a result of works, so that no one may boast."*
>
> **Reformer Quote – Martin Luther (Romans Preface, 1522)**  
> *"Faith is a living, daring confidence in God’s grace… it is a living and unshakable confidence."*

---

## 3. **Sola Gratia (Grace Alone)**

**Salvation is the result of God’s unmerited favor. It cannot be earned by human effort, but is a free gift rooted in God’s sovereign will.**

> **Ephesians 2:8–9**  
> *(See above under Sola Fide)*  
>
> **Romans 11:6**  
> *"But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, since otherwise grace is no longer grace."*
>
> **Reformer Quote – Philipp Melanchthon (Loci Communes, 1554)**  
> *"Sola gratia justificamus et sola fide justificamur — by grace alone we are justified and by faith alone we are justified."*

---

## 4. **Solus Christus (Christ Alone)**

**Jesus Christ is the only mediator between God and humanity. Salvation is accomplished solely through His perfect life, sacrificial death, and victorious resurrection.**

> **1 Timothy 2:5**  
> *"For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus."*  
>
> **Acts 4:12**  
> *"And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among mankind by which we must be saved."*  
>
> **John 14:6**  
> *"Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.'"*
>
> **Reformer Quote – John Calvin (Institutes, 2.15.6)**  
> *"Christ is the beginning, middle, and end—from which we must draw all that we need and in which we must seek and find all things."*

---

## 5. **Soli Deo Gloria (To the Glory of God Alone)**

**All of life and salvation exists for God's glory alone. Human boasting is excluded; only God's name is exalted.**

> **1 Corinthians 10:31**  
> *"Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all things for the glory of God."*  
>
> **Romans 11:36**  
> *"For from Him, and through Him, and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen."*  
>
> **Psalm 115:1**  
> *"Not to us, Lord, not to us, but to Your name give glory, because of Your mercy, because of Your truth."*
>
> **Reformer Quote – Westminster Shorter Catechism, Q1**  
> *"Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy Him forever."*
