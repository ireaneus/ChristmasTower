4. **Ephesians 2:3-5 (NASB 2020)**  
   *Among them we too all previously lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the rest. But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our wrongdoings, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved).*

5. **Colossians 3:6-7 (NASB 2020)**  
   *For it is because of these things that the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience, and in them you also once walked, when you were living in them.*

6. **Revelation 3:10 (NASB 2020)**

7. **Isaiah 26:20-21 (NASB 2020)**  
   *Come, My people, enter your rooms and close your doors behind you; hide for a little while until indignation runs its course. For behold, the Lord is about to come out from His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their wrongdoing.*

8. **Psalm 103:8-10 (NASB 2020)**  
   *The Lord is compassionate and gracious, Slow to anger and abounding in mercy. He will not always contend with us, Nor will He keep His anger forever. He has not dealt with us according to our sins, Nor rewarded us according to our guilty deeds.*

9. **Romans 8:1 (NASB 2020)**  
   *Therefore, there is now no condemnation at all for those who are in Christ Jesus.*

10. **Zephaniah 2:3 (NASB 2020)**  
    *Seek the Lord, all you humble of the earth who have practiced His ordinances; Seek righteousness, seek humility. Perhaps you will remain hidden on the day of the Lord’s anger.*

## *Coming of the Lord precedes the Day of the Lord 1 Thess 5:1-4*

**1 Thess 4:6**

> 6 *"And that no one violate the rights and take advantage of his brother or sister in the matter, because the **Lord is the avenger** in all these things, just as we also told you previously and solemnly warned you."*

**1 Thess 4:13-18**

> 13 *"But we do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, about those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no **hope**."*
> 14 *"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus."*
> 15 *"For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until **the coming of the Lord**, will not precede those who have fallen asleep."*
> 16 *"For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first."*
> 17 *"Then we who are alive and remain will be **caught up** together with them in the clouds to **meet the Lord in the air**, and so **we shall always be with the Lord.**"*
> 18 *"Therefore comfort one another with these words."*

## *Day of the Lord*

**1 Thess 5:1-7**

> 1 *"Now as to the periods and times, brothers and sisters, you have no need of anything to be written to you."*
> 2 *"For you yourselves know full well that the **day of the Lord** is coming just like a thief in the night."*
> 3 *"While they are saying, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction will come upon them like labor pains upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. 4But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness, so that the day would overtake you like a thief; 5for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We are not of night nor of darkness; 6so then, let’s not sleep as others do, but let’s be alert and sober. 7For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who are drunk, get drunk at night."*

**1 Thess 2:1-8**  

>Now we request you, brethren, with regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, 2that you not be quickly shaken from your composure or be disturbed either by a spirit or a message or a letter as if from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come. 3Let no one in any way deceive you, for it will not come unless the apostasy comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, 4who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, displaying himself as being God. 5Do you not remember that while I was still with you, I was telling you these things? 6And you know what restrains him now, so that in his time he will be revealed. 7For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only he who now restrains will do so until he is taken out of the way. 8Then that lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord will slay with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of His coming;

**John 14:1-3**

> “Do not let your heart be troubled;  believe in God, believe also in Me. 2In My Father’s house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. 3If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also.

**1 Corinth 15:51-57**

>Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed, 52in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. 53For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality. 54But when this perishable will have put on the imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come about the saying that is written, “Death is swallowed up in victory. 55O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?” 56The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law; 57but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

### Significance of the Feast of Booths

The **Feast of Booths**, also known as the **Feast of Tabernacles** (Hebrew: **Sukkot**), is a significant biblical festival celebrated by the Jewish people. It is synonymous with the Feast of the Tabernacle, and in modern Judaism, it is still referred to as **Sukkot**.

#### Biblical Background

- **Commemorates Israel's Wilderness Journey**: The Feast of Booths was instituted by God as a remembrance of the Israelites’ 40-year journey in the wilderness, during which they lived in temporary shelters or "booths" (*Leviticus 23:42-43*). It recalls God’s provision and protection during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land.
- **Thanksgiving for the Harvest**: It is also an agricultural festival, marking the ingathering of the final harvest of the year (*Exodus 23:16; Leviticus 23:39*), a time of thanksgiving for God’s blessings.

#### Key Observances

- **Dwelling in Booths (Sukkot)**: Observant Jews construct temporary shelters, or "sukkot," and eat or sleep in them during the week-long festival, as a physical reminder of the temporary dwellings of their ancestors.
- **Lulav and Etrog**: Worshipers wave the four species—palm branch (lulav), myrtle (hadas), willow (aravah), and citron (etrog)—in a ritual acknowledging God’s provision (*Leviticus 23:40*).

---

### Modern Jewish Observance

In modern Judaism, **Sukkot** remains one of the most joyous and important holidays. It is often called the "Season of Our Joy" (*z'man simchateinu*), emphasizing gratitude for both material and spiritual blessings. It follows Yom Kippur and is celebrated for seven days in Israel (eight days in the diaspora). The eighth day is **Shemini Atzeret**, a separate festival connected to Sukkot.

#### Themes in Contemporary Judaism

- **Trust in God**: The temporary nature of the sukkah reminds worshipers of reliance on God rather than material security.
- **Unity and Joy**: Sukkot is marked by communal meals, singing, and celebration, fostering a sense of unity and gratitude.

---

### New Testament and Messianic Significance

In the New Testament, Jesus attended the Feast of Booths in Jerusalem (*John 7:1-52*). During this feast, He declared, *“If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink”* (*John 7:37*), referring to the living water, which pointed to the Holy Spirit. The themes of God’s provision and the future messianic kingdom are strongly tied to this festival.

#### Eschatological Fulfillment

- **Zechariah 14:16-19** prophesies that all nations will observe the Feast of Booths during the reign of the Messiah, emphasizing its role in the messianic age.

---

### Synonyms and Modern Names

- **Biblical Name**: Feast of Booths or Feast of Tabernacles
- **Modern Hebrew Name**: Sukkot (סֻכּוֹת)
- **Modern Observance**: Known simply as Sukkot by Jews worldwide, it retains its biblical significance while also reflecting modern agricultural themes and communal joy.
