## Opening Scripture

> **"Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."**  
> *—Psalm 119:105 (ESV)*

> **"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  
He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.  
In him was life, and the life was the light of men."**  
> *—John 1:1–4 (ESV)*

## A Quick Story

![4 teens in the forest](/SolaDeo/assets/blog/teensforest.webp)

Imagine you’re dropped into a giant forest with no roads, no signs, and no phone. Just trees. Scary, right?

Now imagine someone hands you a flashlight and a map. Suddenly, you know where to go, where the dangers are, and how to find the right path home.

That’s what God’s Word is like for our lives. The Bible is the light that shows us where to step and the map that points us to Jesus.

## Devotional Insight

**Sola Scriptura** means *Scripture Alone*. That’s a big phrase, but it just means that God’s Word is our top authority. Not opinions, not trends, not even our own feelings. When we want to know what’s right or true, we look to the Bible first.

But here’s something even more amazing—**Jesus Himself is called “the Word”**. John 1 tells us that Jesus is the living Word who was with God and is God. He created all things, and He is **the light of life**.

So when we read the Bible, we’re not just getting advice or rules—we’re seeing Jesus. The Bible helps us know Him better, love Him more, and follow His path.

## Prayer Prompt

Thank Jesus for being the Word and the Light. Ask Him to help you follow His voice through His Word, even when the path feels dark or confusing.

## Takeaway Thought

**The Bible lights our path because it points us to Jesus—the Word and the Light of the world.**
