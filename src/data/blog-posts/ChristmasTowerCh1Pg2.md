![Jacob Tower and Ben](/ChristmasTower/images/JacobTowerBen.webp)

One day, Jacob, the father of the 12 tribes of Israel, pitched his tent beyond the tower. His heart was heavy with sorrow, for his beloved wife Rachel had just passed away after giving birth to a baby boy. With her final breath Rachel said, *“He shall be called Ben-Oni, son of my sorrow”* **(Genesis 35:18, ESV)**. But Jacob, though overwhelmed with grief, replied,*“No, his name shall be Benjamin, son of my right hand.”*
