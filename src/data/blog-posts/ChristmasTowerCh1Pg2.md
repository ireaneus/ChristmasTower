## Chapter 1 – Jacob Buries Rachel

![Jacob Tower and Ben](/ChristmasTower/images/JacobTowerBen.webp)

One day, Jacob, the grandson of Abraham, pitched his tent beyond the tower. His heart was heavy with sorrow, for his beloved wife Rachel had just passed away after giving birth to a baby boy. With her final breath, Rachel named him *Ben-Oni*, meaning “son of my sorrow” (Genesis 35:18). But Jacob, though overwhelmed with grief, gave his son a new name—*Benjamin*, meaning “son of my right hand.”  

The tower stood silently as if sharing Jacob’s sorrow. It watched as Jacob buried Rachel near Bethlehem, setting up a memorial stone to mark her resting place. Yet, even in this moment of sadness, something greater was unfolding—God’s perfect plan was quietly at work. Though Jacob couldn’t yet see it, the tower seemed to stand as a silent promise that joy would one day come from this sorrow.  

Many years later, in these same fields, the tower would witness another birth—one that would bring hope and salvation to the whole world.
