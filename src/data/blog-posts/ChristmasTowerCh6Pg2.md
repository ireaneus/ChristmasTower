## Chapter 6 – Refuge at Migdal Eder  

As they moved away from the crowded town, Joseph’s eyes caught the outline of the **Tower of the Flock**, silhouetted against the starry sky. A soft glow spilled from the entrance, almost as if beckoning the weary couple to come and rest.  

Though it was just a simple shelter, Joseph felt peace wash over him. He gently guided Mary toward the tower, trusting they would find warmth and protection within its walls. Inside, the thick stone walls sheltered them from the night’s chill, and fresh straw covered the floor, offering a soft place to rest.
