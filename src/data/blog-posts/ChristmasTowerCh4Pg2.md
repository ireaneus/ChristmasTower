From that day on, the Tower of the Flock carried a greater purpose. To the shepherds it was still called Migdal Eder, but to us, it has a new name — The Christmas Tower.

The Christmas Tower now had a holy purpose. No longer just a shelter from storms, it became part of God’s promise of salvation. Each spotless lamb wrapped in cloths was a picture of something greater still—the Lamb of God who would one day take away the sins of the world.  

Though the fields around Migdal Eder were calm and peaceful, it felt as if something important was about to happen. It was as if the whole world was waiting for a promise to be fulfilled. The Tower, strong and steady, stood in the center of it all—watching, waiting, and knowing that soon, God’s greatest promise would come true.
