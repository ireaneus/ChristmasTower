## Chapter 4 – Shadows of a Greater Lamb  

The Levitical shepherds worked carefully, ensuring every lamb remained spotless. If a lamb was found to be perfect, they wrapped it gently in **swaddling cloths** to keep it clean and safe. Then, they placed it in a **manger**, where it could rest quietly, unblemished and protected.  

Unlike ordinary shepherds, these priests knew they were part of something much greater. Each lamb pointed to a promise of redemption. Though they did not yet know how or when, they trusted God’s perfect plan was unfolding—and the tower stood as a silent witness to their faithfulness.  

The fields grew still with quiet anticipation, as if creation itself held its breath. The tower, ancient and steadfast, seemed to wait for the moment when God’s greatest promise would be fulfilled.
