One day i was alone with Michael and he asked “How does God speak to you, Papa?” I told him:
“God speaks primarily through His Word. And when we read it, He stirs something in our hearts so we know it’s real. 

That’s how I know He spoke to both you and Samuel, He spoke to both you. He stirred your hearts to make this incredible decision and that is why we are here today to witness your obedience to follow Jesus.

God made a covenant—a promise. A long time ago, 
God making covenant with God on behalf of Abram.  
Hebrews 6:13-14 For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear an oath by no one greater, He swore by Himself, saying, “INDEED I WILL GREATLY BLESS YOU AND I WILL GREATLY MULTIPLY YOU.”

you see baptism is not to be confused with salvation a long time ago God made that promise with Abram and it worked itself out when Jesus died buried and resurrection.  so in the same manner God made that same promise for you two and with us as well that believe on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ

Matthew 3:16-17 After He was baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and settling on Him, and behold, a voice from the heavens said, “This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”


This is the start of your journey.
It’s not always going to be easy. Jesus said:

> “In this world you will have trouble, but take heart; I have overcome the world.”
—John 16:33


That’s the life ahead of you—learning to hear His voice, trusting Him, even when it’s hard, and becoming more like Him every day.

And one day, if you stay faithful, you’ll hear the words that every believer longs to hear:

> “Well done, good and faithful servant.”
—Matthew 25:21



So today, I’m proud of you—not just because you’re getting baptized, but because you’re answering God’s voice.
