One day I was alone with Michael and he asked me, “Papa, how does God speak to you?”

I told him,  
**“God speaks primarily through His Word. And when we read it, He stirs something in our hearts so we know it’s real.”**

And that’s how I know He spoke to both you and Samuel. He stirred your hearts to make this decision—and that’s why we’re here today—to witness your obedience as you follow Jesus.

A long time ago, God made a promise.  
He made a covenant—a sacred agreement—with Abraham. But this covenant was really God making a promise to Himself on behalf of Abraham.

> **Hebrews 6:13-14 (NASB)**  
> *"For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear an oath by no one greater, He swore by Himself, saying, 'Indeed I will greatly bless you and I will greatly multiply you.'"*

That promise was fulfilled when Jesus died, was buried, and rose again.  
And now that same promise is for all who believe in Him.

So remember—**baptism isn’t what saves you.**  
Salvation came from God’s promise and Jesus’ finished work.  
But baptism is your **first step of obedience.** It’s a way of saying,  
**“I’m in—I want to follow Jesus.”**

Jesus did it first. He showed us the way:

> **Matthew 3:16-17 (NASB)**  
> *"After He was baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and settling on Him, and behold, a voice from the heavens said, 'This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.'"*

Now it’s your turn.  
This is the start of your journey.

It won’t always be easy. Jesus Himself said:

> **John 16:33 (NASB)**  
> *“In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world.”*

That’s the road ahead—learning to hear His voice, trusting Him when it’s hard, and becoming more like Him every day.

And one day, if you stay faithful, you’ll hear the words that every believer longs to hear:

> **Matthew 25:21 (NASB)**  
> *“Well done, good and faithful servant.”*

So today, I’m proud of you—not just because you’re getting baptized,  
but because you’re **answering God’s voice.**
