Baptism Speech Notes

1. God Speaks to Us

Begin by telling the boys how God speaks.
Use the question: “How does God speak to you?”

Explain:

> “God speaks primarily through His Word. He stirs our hearts when we hear it—just like He stirred yours.”



Examples:

Elijah — God wasn’t in the wind, the fire, or the earthquake... but in the still small voice (1 Kings 19:11–12).

Samuel — As a boy, Samuel heard God call his name. He learned to say, “Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening” (1 Samuel 3:10).


Point to make:
God still speaks to us today—through Scripture, and through His Spirit working in our hearts.

2. The Baptism of Jesus

Transition to Jesus’ baptism:

> “Jesus didn’t need to be baptized for repentance, but He did it to fulfill all righteousness and to show us the way.”



Matthew 3:16–17 – The heavens opened, the Spirit descended like a dove, and the Father said, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”

Jesus set the pattern for us: He heard His Father’s voice, and He obeyed.


Point to make:
Baptism is your public declaration that you want to follow Jesus—it’s your first act of obedience after being saved.

3. The Journey Will Be Hard (Tribulation of the Saints)

> “Now that you’ve decided to follow Jesus, I want to be honest—it won’t always be easy.”



John 16:33 – “In this world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.”

Acts 14:22 – “Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.”


Point to make:
Following Jesus means walking a narrow path—but He walks it with you.

4. Your Goal: To Hear ‘Well Done’

> “If you keep walking with Him, listening for His voice, and staying faithful, one day you’ll hear the greatest words of all…”



Matthew 25:21 – “Well done, good and faithful servant. Enter into the joy of your Master.”


Point to make:
