## 🌿 Irresistible Grace (TULIP)

> _“All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will certainly not cast out.”_ — **John 6:37**

**Irresistible Grace** is part of the Reformed doctrine known as the "Five Points of Calvinism," represented by the "I" in the TULIP acronym. It teaches that when God extends His saving grace to the elect, they will inevitably come to faith—God’s sovereign will cannot be thwarted.

### 🔑 Key Aspects

#### 1. **Effectual Calling**

God’s call to salvation is not merely an invitation—it accomplishes what He intends.  
📖 **Romans 8:29–30**  
_"For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son... and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also justified..."_

#### 2. **Monergistic Work**

Salvation is entirely God's work (monergism), not a cooperative effort with man.

#### 3. **Transforming the Will**

God regenerates the heart to respond.  
📖 **Ezekiel 36:26–27**  
_"I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you... I will put My Spirit within you and bring it about that you walk in My statutes..."_

#### 4. **The Holy Spirit’s Role**

God draws sinners powerfully and personally.  
📖 **John 6:44**  
_"No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him..."_

## 📖 Further Biblical Support

- 📖 **Acts 16:14** — “The Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul.”
- 📖 **Philippians 2:13** — “It is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure.”
- 📖 **Ephesians 1:4–5**, **Ephesians 2:4–10**

## 🧠 Theological Perspectives

### 🔹 Reformed View

- God’s grace is sovereign and effectual.
- Grace regenerates, leading to repentance and faith.
- Salvation is **guaranteed for the elect**.

### 🔸 Arminian Response

- God's grace is **resistible**.
- While God initiates, man must respond.
- Salvation is possible for all but not ensured for any.

## 🐑 Illustration

A shepherd finds his sheep entangled in thorns. He doesn’t merely call—it cannot come. Instead, he reaches in, untangles it, lifts it onto his shoulders, and carries it home. This is irresistible grace: it does not ask the sheep’s permission; it **saves**.

## 🌤️ Prevenient Grace

> _"But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."_ — **Romans 5:8**

**Prevenient Grace** is the grace that "goes before"—enabling the sinner to hear, respond, and choose, even though still dead in sin. It is a key concept in **Wesleyan-Arminian** theology.

### 🔑 Key Aspects

#### 1. **God’s Initiative**

God acts first to initiate a response.  
📖 **John 6:44**, **Philippians 2:13**

#### 2. **Enabling the Dead**

While man is spiritually dead, prevenient grace awakens a capacity to respond.  
📖 **Ephesians 2:4–5**  
_"God... made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in our transgressions..."_

#### 3. **Universal Extension**

This grace is given to all humanity.  
📖 **Titus 2:11**  
_"For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people..."_  
📖 **John 12:32**  
_"And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to Myself."_

#### 4. **Conviction and Illumination**

The Spirit convicts and invites, not compels.  
📖 **John 16:8**  
_"And He, when He comes, will convict the world regarding sin, and righteousness, and judgment..."_

## ✍️ Summary

**Irresistible Grace** assures that God’s chosen people will believe because of His sovereign intervention.  
**Prevenient Grace** affirms that God enables **everyone** to believe, but they must choose to respond.

> _“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God...”_ — **Ephesians 2:8–9**

---

> 🧭 **Two Views, One God**  
> Both views affirm: Salvation begins with God.  
> Reformed theology sees God’s grace as **unstoppable**;  
> Arminian theology sees it as **indispensable yet resistible**.  
> **In both cases, it is God who saves—and to Him belongs all glory.**
