## 🌿 Irresistible Grace (TULIP)

> _“All that the Father gives Me will come to Me…”_ — **John 6:37**

**Irresistible grace** is part of the Reformed doctrine known as the "Five Points of Calvinism," represented by the "I" in the TULIP acronym. It teaches that when God extends His saving grace to the elect, it results in guaranteed salvation—God’s will cannot be thwarted.

### 🔑 Key Aspects

#### 1. **Effectual Calling**
God’s effectual call always results in a saving response.  
📖 _Romans 8:30_

#### 2. **Monergistic Work**
Salvation is solely God's doing—not a partnership between divine initiative and human effort.

#### 3. **Transforming the Will**
God replaces the heart of stone with a heart of flesh.  
📖 _Ezekiel 36:26-27_

#### 4. **The Holy Spirit’s Role**
The Spirit draws the elect with a power that cannot ultimately be resisted.  
📖 _John 6:44_

---

## 📖 Biblical Support

- **John 6:44** — _"No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him..."_
- **Acts 16:14** — _"The Lord opened her heart..."_
- **Philippians 2:13** — _"It is God who is at work in you..."_
- **Ezekiel 36:26-27**  
- **Romans 8**, **Ephesians 1 & 2**

---

## 🧠 Theological Perspectives

### Reformed View
God’s grace **guarantees** salvation for the elect. Human resistance may occur, but it will be overcome.

### Arminian View
God’s grace is **resistible**. Salvation is possible but not assured; it respects human freedom.

## 🐑 Illustration

Imagine a shepherd seeking his lost sheep—not calling from afar, but climbing into the thorns, lifting the lamb, and carrying it home. The sheep does not resist—it is rescued. So it is with God’s grace: **it saves effectively.**

## 🌤️ Prevenient Grace

> _"While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."_ — **Romans 5:8**

**Prevenient Grace** refers to the divine grace that comes before human decision. It prepares and enables the heart to respond freely to God’s call.

### 🔑 Key Aspects

#### 1. **God’s Initiative**
God moves first, not man.  
📖 _John 6:44_, _Philippians 2:13_

#### 2. **Enabling Grace**
Though spiritually dead, the sinner is enabled to respond.  
📖 _Ephesians 2:4-5_, _Romans 2:4_

#### 3. **Universal Offer**
This grace is extended to all.  
📖 _Titus 2:11_, _John 12:32_

#### 4. **Conviction of Sin**
The Holy Spirit convicts and draws.  
📖 _John 16:8_

---

## ✍️ Summary

**Prevenient Grace** is God's **initial spark**—a universal grace that awakens the heart, convicts the soul, and gives the sinner the **freedom to choose** salvation. It is _not irresistible_, but it is always divine in origin.

📖 _Ephesians 2:8-9_ — _"For by grace you have been saved through faith..."_

---

> 🧭 **Two Views, One Purpose:**  
> Both doctrines affirm that **salvation begins with God**, not man. Whether one believes grace is **irresistible** or **prevenient**, the result is the same: **God gets all the glory.**
