Each morning, Ruth gathered grain in the fields beneath the tower. Though a stranger, she felt safe under its watchful eye. One day Boaz, the owner of the fields, noticed her, she fell to the ground, and asked him softly, *“Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?”*  But Boaz answered her, *“All that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband has been fully told to me, and how you left your father and mother and your native land and came to a people that you did not know before.”* **(Ruth 2:10-11)**

Day by day, as the tower watched, their friendship grew. Eventually, Boaz became Ruth’s kinsman redeemer—the one who rescued and cared for her family. He married Ruth, giving her a new beginning and restoring hope to both her and Naomi.
