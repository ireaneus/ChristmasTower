## Chapter 2 – Boaz Shows Kindness  

![Ruth](/ChristmasTower/images/Ruth.webp)

Each morning, Ruth would come to the fields beneath the tower to pluck grains from their stems. Though she was a stranger in the land, she felt safe under the watchful eye of the tower, as if it was quietly assuring her that she belonged. The tower observed her hard work and quiet determination, standing as a silent witness to her faithfulness and trust in God’s provision.  

One day, Boaz, the owner of the fields, came to meet Ruth. Boaz was a kind and generous man, and he admired Ruth’s loyalty to Naomi. He made sure she had more than enough grain to take home, offering her protection and kindness. Day by day, as the tower watched, their friendship grew.
