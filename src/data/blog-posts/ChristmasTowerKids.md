All through the Bible, God was showing us pictures of Jesus. Jacob’s sorrow and joy, Ruth’s rescuer, David the shepherd-king, and the spotless lambs—all of them pointed to God’s Son. At just the right time, Jesus came—the Lamb of God, the King, the Redeemer.

The Bible says: “Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, He was buried, and He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures” (1 Corinthians 15:3–4, ESV).

That’s the good news—God planned it all because He loves you. And just like the shepherds, you can believe this news and share it with others.
