From the very beginning, God was pointing us to Jesus. When Rachel named her son *“son of my sorrow”* and Jacob renamed him *“son of my right hand,”* we are reminded of Christ—the Man of Sorrows who bore our griefs, and the risen Son now seated at the Father’s right hand. When Ruth was rescued by Boaz, we saw a *kinsman redeemer*, showing us how Christ stepped in to redeem His people. When David was anointed as king, the Tower watched a shepherd boy chosen by God, pointing forward to the greater Son of David who reigns forever. And when spotless lambs were wrapped in cloths and laid in a manger, they foreshadowed the true *Lamb of God*, pure and without blemish, who takes away the sins of the world

If you are reading this with your children, explain that the Bible is one story — and Jesus is at the center of it. Every character and picture in Scripture points to Him. One simple way to share the gospel with kids is to use three truths, with verses you can read together:

1. **God made us — He loves us and wants us to know Him.**

- *“So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.”*  
(Genesis 1:27, ESV)
- *“See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are.”*  
(1 John 3:1, ESV)

2. **We sinned — we turned away from Him and need to be rescued.**

- *“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”*
(Romans 3:23, ESV)
- *“For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”*
(Romans 6:23,ESV)

3. **Jesus saves us — He died for our sins, was buried, and rose again so we can be forgiven and live with Him forever.**

- *“But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”*
(Romans 5:8, ESV)
- *“For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, 4that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,”*
(1 Corinthians 15:3–4, ESV)

Then pray with them, and like the shepherds, share the *good news* with others.
