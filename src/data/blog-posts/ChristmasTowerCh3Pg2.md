When David was brought in, God spoke to Samuel, saying, *“Arise, anoint him, for this is he”* **(1 Samuel 16:12, ESV)**. Right there, in the presence of his family, Samuel poured oil over David’s head, anointing him as the future king of Israel. The Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward, and the Tower stood as a proud witness to this remarkable event.

Though David was anointed as king, he didn’t become king right away. He returned to the fields, continuing to care for the sheep while trusting in God’s timing. The Tower looked on as Samuel poured the oil, as if it knew this boy’s future would change Israel forever.  

David may have been the youngest and overlooked by others, but God had seen him. In the quiet fields of Bethlehem, the shepherd boy was learning to lead, until the day he would return as king.
