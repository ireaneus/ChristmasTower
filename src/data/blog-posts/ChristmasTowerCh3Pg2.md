## Chapter 3 – David Anointed  

When David was brought in, God spoke to Samuel, saying, **“Arise, anoint him, for this is he”** (1 Samuel 16:12, ESV). Right there, in the presence of his family, Samuel poured oil over David’s head, anointing him as the future king of Israel.  

From that day forward, the Spirit of the Lord came upon David, and the tower stood as a silent witness to this remarkable moment.  

Though David was anointed king, he didn’t become king right away. He returned to the fields, continuing to care for the sheep, while trusting God’s perfect timing. The tower watched David grow in strength and faith, knowing God was preparing him for something greater.
