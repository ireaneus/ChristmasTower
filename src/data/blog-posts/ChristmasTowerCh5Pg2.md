## Chapter 5 – Hope Near the Tower  

As the couple drew closer to Bethlehem, they passed fields where shepherds tended their sheep beneath the fading light. Mary took in the peaceful scene, remembering the stories Joseph had told her—of Ruth gleaning grain and finding her redeemer, and of David, anointed king in these very fields.
