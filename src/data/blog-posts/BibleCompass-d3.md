## Day 3 for the SD Crew – Abi hears the Good News

### Scene 7 – Back at the Farmhouse

The sun was dipping low when the Crew returned to the farmhouse for supper. Grammy had spread bread, cheese, and jars of fresh jam across the table. Papa was outside feeding the animals, and the younger kids ran about in the yard, laughing in the fading light.

Abi sat quietly on the porch steps, twirling a flower between her fingers. Beside her sat Britt, her foster mom, who had joined them on the journey, talking to Abi in ASL sign.

“Why does Papa always read verses to us?” Abi asked, her brow furrowed. “I don’t always understand what they mean.”

Britt smiled gently. “I wondered the same thing when I first heard the Bible read out loud. Do you know what the verses are really pointing to?”

Abi shook her head. “Not really. I mean, I know they’re about God… but I don’t know Him the way Samuel and Michael do. They always seem so sure.”

### Scene 8 – The Gospel Explained

Britt leaned forward. “Papa says God made us to know Him and walk with Him. But we all disobey—every single one of us. That’s called sin. Sin hurts our friendship with God and separates us from Him.”

Abi’s eyes grew wide. “So what happens because of our sin?”

Britt opened her lantern and pointed to the light flickering inside. “The Bible says, *‘The wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord’* (Romans 6:23). That means the punishment for sin is death, but Jesus took our punishment on the cross. And when we trust Him, God gives us eternal life as a gift.”

Abi traced her finger over the wooden porch rail. “So Jesus died for me… even though I’ve disobeyed?”

“Yes,” Britt said firmly. “That’s the good news. Jesus didn’t stay dead—He rose again. And now anyone who believes in Him can be forgiven and belong to Him forever.”

Abi whispered, almost to herself, “I never knew it was for me too.”

### Scene 9 – A New Light

Just then, Reagan came skipping up with Charlie toddling behind. She handed Abi the flowers she’d gathered earlier. “Here—you should have these. They’re too pretty to keep to myself.”

Abi smiled faintly and tucked the flowers into her lap. For the first time, she felt the truth settling into her heart like the glow of her lantern.

Papa’s voice called from the yard, “Children, come in! It’s time for our evening prayer.”

As they stood, Britt leaned close to Abi. “If you ever want to talk more, I’ll walk with you. That’s what family is for.”

Abi nodded slowly, clutching the flowers. The lantern at her side flickered a little brighter, as if the light itself was waiting for her answer.

## SD Crew and Family Prayer time

“Lord, thank You for the gift of eternal life in Jesus. Help me to understand more of Your love, and give me faith to believe in You.”

## The SD Crew Thought for the day

The gospel is good news: though we are sinners, Jesus died and rose again so we can belong to Him forever.
