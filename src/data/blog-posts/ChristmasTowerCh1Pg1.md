![Jacob and the Tower](/ChristmasTower/images/JacobTower.webp)

Long ago, in the quiet hills of a region called Canaan (now Israel), there stood a special tower named *Migdal Eder*, which means “The Tower of the Flock.” Built from strong stones, each perfectly placed as if a master architect had carefully laid them, the tower had stood for generations. It had weathered countless storms that tried to shake it from its solid rock foundation, yet it remained steadfast. Ancient and timeless, it seemed the tower had been placed there when the world was formed—an enduring presence providing shelter and safety. From this tower, shepherds protected their sheep from prowling wolves, wild winds, and cruel robbers who came only to kill, steal, and destroy.
