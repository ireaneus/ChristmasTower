## Overview of the Day of the Lord

> **1 Thessalonians 5:2–3**
> *“For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night. While they are saying, ‘Peace and safety!’ then sudden destruction will come...”*

Unlike the comfort of the Rapture, this day brings judgment. It is sudden, global, and inescapable.

## Old Testament Descriptions

> **Malachi 4:5** – *“Before the great and terrible day of the Lord.”*
> **Isaiah 34:8** – *“The day of vengeance.”*
> **Joel 2:2** – *“A day of darkness and gloom.”*
> **Jeremiah 30:7** – *“The time of Jacob’s trouble.”*
> **Daniel 11:36** – *“The indignation.”*

This day is repeatedly prophesied and characterized by judgment, upheaval, and the refining of Israel.

## Purpose of the Tribulation

* To judge the world’s rebellion (Isaiah 13:11)
* To bring Israel to repentance (Zech. 12:10; Dan. 9:24)
* To destroy the Antichrist (2 Thess. 2:8)
* To demonstrate God's holiness and sovereignty (Rev. 14–19)

## Scriptural Names and Themes

* **The Time of Jacob’s Trouble** – Jeremiah 30:7
* **The Indignation** – Daniel 11:36
* **The Day of Vengeance** – Isaiah 34:8
* **The Day of Darkness** – Joel 2:2
* **The Day of Jehovah** – Joel 1:15
* **The Great and Terrible Day** – Malachi 4:5

## The Restrainer and the Rise of Lawlessness

> **2 Thessalonians 2:6–8**
> *“The mystery of lawlessness is already at work... he who now restrains will do so until he is removed.”*

After the Church is removed, lawlessness is unleashed. Then the man of lawlessness is revealed.

## The Day of Atonement and Israel’s Repentance

Just as the Day of Atonement in Leviticus 23 was for national cleansing, so too will Israel one day mourn and turn to her Messiah.

> **Zechariah 12:10**
> *“They will look on Me whom they have pierced...”*

> **Romans 11:26**
> *“...all Israel will be saved.”*

## The Second Coming and Millennial Reign

> **Revelation 19:11–15** – Christ returns in power
> **Zechariah 14:4** – His feet touch the Mount of Olives
> **Zechariah 14:16** – All nations celebrate Tabernacles

This concludes the Day of the Lord and begins Christ’s reign.
