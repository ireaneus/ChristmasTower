They stepped into the Christmas Tower’s sheltered doorway, and in the soft glow of a small lamp, they saw Him—the baby, wrapped in swaddling cloth and lying in a manger, just as the angel had said. Tears filled their eyes as they knelt before the child. It felt like time stopped as they thought about how much they needed this Savior, their Messiah. In that moment, they gave Him all their attention, not just as shepherds, but as people who had found hope in the One who had come to save them.

They had been given the most important message of all time. Their voices rang out in the night as they called to anyone who would listen:

---

> *“For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.”*
>
> **(Isaiah 9:6)**

---

Heaven and earth had met in that small, quiet place, simple shepherds, in an ordinary town, had witnessed the Creator of the universe lying in a manger.
