## Chapter 7 – Good News and Glad Tidings  

Outside the Tower, in the fields near Bethlehem, the Levitical shepherd priests were tending their flocks. These humble men, often overlooked by society, cared for lambs destined for sacrifice at the Temple in Jerusalem.  

Suddenly, the quiet night was shattered by a radiant brilliance unlike anything they had ever seen. The dark sky blazed with light, illuminating the fields in shimmering glory. The shepherds shielded their eyes, trembling with fear, as an angel of the Lord appeared before them.  

“Do not be afraid,” the angel said gently, his voice calm and steady. “I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. Today, in the city of David, a Savior has been born for you. He is Christ the Lord. This will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.”
