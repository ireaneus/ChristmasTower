## Introduction

Welcome to my first blog post using blogger.com, we will look into the life of Lot, diving into both the Old and New Testaments we will explore the themes of disobedience, redemption, and the transformative power of God's grace as they unfold in Lot's story.

Throughout this series, we will examine this biblical narrative and draw parallels to our lives as contemporary believers. We will uncover the relevance of Lot's story for American Christians today, challenging us to confront complacency and rekindle our passion to become radically obedient to God.

### Part 1: Lot's family history

In this first installment, we begin by looking at the history of Lot's beginnings, Abram's disobedience, and God's sovereign plan to bring redemption to Lot. Through careful examination, we will reveal God's sovereign will, and to His redemptive purpose.

Let's begin by looking at the key verses for Part 1 in this series.

#### Bible Verses (NASB2020)

**Genesis 12:1**

> *"Now the Lord said to Abram,
“Go from your country,
And from your relatives
And from your father’s house,
To the land which I will show you;.."*

>**Genesis 12:4**
> *"So Abram went away as the Lord had spoken to him; and Lot went with him."*
>
> **2 Peter 2:7-8** - Lot's Anchor verses
> 7 *"and if He rescued righteous Lot, who was oppressed by the perverted conduct of unscrupulous people"*
>8 *"(for by what he saw and heard that righteous man, while living among them, felt his righteous soul tormented day after day by their lawless deeds),"*

### Lot's family historical significance

To gain a deeper understanding of God's character and the unfolding events, let's take a step back and delve into a historical lesson. It's important to read **Genesis Chapter 11:27-32** and **Acts 7:2-7** for context. As we examine the sequence of events, we discover that God spoke to Abram while he was still in Mesopotamia, prior to his residence in Haran **(Acts 7:2)**. Terah, Abram's father, took Abram and Lot, his grandson, back to their ancestral hometown of Haran (Terah had named his third son after the city) **Genesis 11:31**.

Interestingly, Terah, being a pagan worshiper **(Joshua 24:2)**, was seemingly directed by the "Living God" to return to his homeland for reasons unknown to us. It appears that God made it easier for Abram to choose the path leading to the promised land. However, Abram did not depart from his father's house (Haran) until after his father's passing, and then he embarked on the journey to the land of Canaan.

### God's Faithfulness

This brings us to a crucial point emphasized in **2 Timothy 2:13:** "If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself" (NASB2020). In this case it seems that God spoke prophetically to Abram, when He said to "And from your father's house", so when they moved to Heran, he would actually be leaving his father's ancestral home. Abram will be leaving all family lineage and starting the family line of David, the line of Promise. It's truly fascinating how all the pieces fell into place, displaying God's faithfulness and wisdom.

Can we examine this a bit, let God speak to you in His Word, what is He saying to you. The fact that Abram waited for his father to pass before embarking on his journey to the promised land indeed raises a thought-provoking connection to the commandment of honoring one's father and mother. In Exodus 20:12, we find the instruction, "Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be prolonged in the land which the LORD your God gives you." And this scripture hadn't been even written yet, showing the Divine directly interacting with His creation to accomplish His perfect will.

## Personal Reflection

Upon reflecting on my own life, I can vividly see God's direct intervention in a specific moment: the day I came to faith. His hand was unmistakably at work when He orchestrated the assignment of my dorm room, aligning it with a Christian roommate. Originally I was slated to be placed across the hall, however an unexpected change occurred that very morning, resulting in my placement with my now Christian brother.

This divine intervention holds a very dear meaning to me as I recognize God's intentional involvement in guiding my spiritual journey. The precise timing of my dorm room placement and the faith-filled atmosphere that (Dave) brought created an environment where my faith could flourish and grow. It serves as a tangible reminder of God's personal care and His desire to draw me closer to Himself.

## Conclusion

The best I can offer to all who are reading this is to proclaim the Gospel, for the good news is contained within the Holy Bible, the Word of God. As you engage with the history lesson we have explored, I urge you not to disregard the message God is speaking to you. In humility, declare to Him, "I believe in the truth revealed in Your Word." This simple act of "faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ." (Romans 10:17, NASB)

As you dive deeper into the Scriptures, you will come to realize your own sinful nature and desperate need for forgiveness. It is through Jesus, God's Son, that this forgiveness is made possible. Jesus is not only the One who paid the penalty for your sins, but He is also the embodiment of the Word, the Way, the Truth, and the Life. In Him, you will discover true life—a life that is abundant and overflowing with God's blessings.

Embracing Jesus as your Lord and Savior is the key to experiencing the abundant life He offers. The Scriptures bear witness to His redemptive work and serve as a guide to understanding His teachings and the path to salvation.
