## Chapter 9 – The Good Shepherd  

Many years passed after that holy night when Jesus was born. Though worn by time, the Tower still stood tall, watching over the fields. Shepherds continued to care for their sheep, but now something greater was unfolding.  

One day, a man walked along the road near the tower. He was not alone—twelve close followers and a crowd walked with Him, listening closely to His words. As He passed, He saw a man suffering with leprosy. Most avoided lepers, but this man did not. He stepped forward, touched the leper, and healed him instantly. The crowd gasped in amazement.  

Then He began to speak, His voice carrying across the fields:  

**“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.”** (John 10:11, ESV)  

The Tower, which had seen the birth of the Lamb of God, now stood as witness to the words of the Good Shepherd Himself.
