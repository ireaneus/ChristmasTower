![Jesus and the Leper](/ChristmasTower/images/JesusLeper.webp)

Many years passed after that special night when Jesus was born. The Christmas Tower though worn by time, still stood tall, watching over the fields where shepherds continued to care for their sheep.

One day, a man walked along the road near the tower. He wasn’t alone—twelve close followers and a group of men and women walked with Him, listening closely to everything He said. As He walked, He noticed a man with leprosy standing nearby. Most people avoided lepers because of their disease, but this man didn’t. The man with leprosy called out, asking for help. Without hesitation, the man stepped forward, touched the leper, and healed him instantly.

The crowd gasped in amazement. No one had ever seen anything like it before. The man turned and looked toward the Christmas Tower. His eyes seemed to reflect the long history of that place—a place where shepherds once watched over lambs meant for sacrifices. With sheep grazing in the nearby fields and shepherds tending their flocks, He began to speak.
