## Chapter 3 – David’s Dedication  

One day, David would return to these fields—not as a shepherd boy, but as a mighty king chosen by God. And when David became king, he never forgot the fields where he had tended sheep or the tower that had stood watch over him.  

He dedicated this very area to a sacred purpose—to be the place where the **Levitical shepherds** would care for the lambs destined for sacrifice at the Temple in Jerusalem. These lambs were to be spotless and perfect, pointing forward to God’s greater promise.  

The tower of the flock now carried a deeper meaning, its stones standing as a guardian not only of shepherds but of a holy calling that would one day be fulfilled in the Lamb of God.
