## Introduction: Not Destined for Wrath

> **1 Thessalonians 5:9**
> *"For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ."*

> **Revelation 3:10**
> *"I also will keep you from the hour of the testing, that hour which is about to come upon the whole world."*

> **Isaiah 26:20–21**
> *"Come, My people, enter your rooms and close your doors behind you; hide for a little while until indignation runs its course..."*

The Church is not appointed to wrath, judgment, or the Day of the Lord. Instead, believers await **the blessed hope**—Christ’s return for His bride.

## The Rapture: Our Gathering to Him

> **1 Thessalonians 4:16–17**
> *"The Lord Himself will descend from heaven... the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive... will be caught up... to meet the Lord in the air."*

> **John 14:1–3**
> *"I go to prepare a place for you... I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also."*

> **Matt. 24:36**
> *"Of that day and hour no one knows... only the Father alone."*

This is a personal, sudden, and joyful reunion—not a wrathful event. We are caught up (Greek: *harpazō*) to be with the Lord forever.

---

## The Resurrection and Transformation

> **1 Corinthians 15:51–52**
> *"We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet."*

> **Hebrews 11:39–40**
> *"...so that apart from us they would not be made perfect."*

Old Testament saints and the Church are made perfect together. This is a corporate glorification of the Bride.

---

## The Bema Seat Judgment

> **2 Corinthians 5:10**
> *"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ..."*

> **1 Corinthians 4:5**
> *"...each person’s praise will come to him from God."*

> **Revelation 22:12**
> *"Behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me..."*

This judgment is for rewards, not condemnation. Believers receive crowns (2 Tim. 4:8, James 1:12, 1 Pet. 5:4).

---

## The Jewish Wedding Picture

> **Genesis 24** – *Abraham sends a servant (Holy Spirit) to find a bride (Rebekah) for Isaac (Son).*
> **John 14:2–3** – *Jesus prepares a place in the Father’s house.*

* The bride is fetched (Rapture)
* 7 days in the Father’s house (prefigures 7-year Tribulation)
* Return to the bride’s home with the Groom (Second Coming)

---

## The Church in Heaven – Revelation 4

> **Revelation 4:1** – *"After these things... a door standing open in heaven..."*

* 24 elders: redeemed humans
* White garments: righteousness of saints
* Crowns: rewards already received (cf. Rev. 3:11)
* 7 Spirits of God (Isa. 11:2) present before the throne

This is the Church in heaven *before* the seals are opened in Revelation 5.

## Foreshadowed in the Fall Feasts

> **Feast of Trumpets (Yom Teruah)** – *Gathering of the saints, announced by trumpet (1 Thess. 4:16)*
> **Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)** – *National repentance, affliction (Zech. 12:10)*
> **Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot)** – *Messiah dwelling with His people (Zech. 14:16–19)*

The fall feasts prophetically outline:

1. **Rapture** (Trumpets)
2. **Tribulation** (Atonement)
3. **Messianic Kingdom** (Tabernacles)
