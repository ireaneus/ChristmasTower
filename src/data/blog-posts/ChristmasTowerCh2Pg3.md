## Chapter 2 – Ruth Redeemed

In time, Boaz became Ruth’s **kinsman redeemer**—stepping in to rescue and restore Naomi’s family. He married Ruth, giving her a new beginning and bringing hope back to their household. Their love story reflected God’s perfect plan: a kindness that covered sorrow and a redemption that turned loss into life.

From the family of Ruth and Boaz came a son, **Obed**; and from Obed came **Jesse**; and from Jesse came **David**—a shepherd who would one day be king. Yet even this royal line was pointing to Someone greater still: the **ultimate Redeemer** who would rescue not just one family, but all who look to Him in faith.
