## Day 2 for the SD Crew – Michael and Samuel follow Jesus

### Scene 4 – The River Crossing

The narrow path twisted deeper into the woods until the sound of rushing water grew louder. The trees opened to reveal a clear, wide river, sunlight flashing across its ripples. A narrow wooden footbridge spanned the slowest part of the current.

The Crew paused at the river’s edge. Grammy spotted a meadow just off the trail where wildflowers danced in the breeze. She led Reagan and little Charlie toward it, giving the others space to sit and listen. Reagan bent to gather blossoms, her bright laughter floating on the air, while Charlie plopped down in the grass and tried to grab the petals drifting in the wind. Grammy smiled, watching them with gentle eyes, her presence a quiet reminder of God’s care.

Papa waited until the others settled near the bank. “Before we cross,” he said, “I want to tell you about another river—the Jordan River, where John the Baptist preached.”

He unrolled the scroll and read:

> “Now in those days John the Baptist *came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, ‘Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.’* … At that time Jerusalem was going out to him, and all Judea and all the region around the Jordan; and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins.” — Matthew 3:1–2, 5–6 (NASB 2020)

Papa looked at the Crew. “People came because they knew they had disobeyed God. They wanted to turn back to Him and be forgiven.”

Samuel tilted his head. “But Jesus didn’t do bad things. Why did He come to John?”

Papa smiled. “You’re right. We sin—we hurt God and break His commands. But Jesus never sinned. He always obeyed His Father. He didn’t need to repent. But He stepped into the water to obey His Father and to show us the way.”

Papa unrolled the scroll again:

> “Then Jesus *arrived from Galilee at the Jordan, coming to John to be baptized by him. But John tried to prevent Him, saying, ‘I have the need to be baptized by You, and yet You are coming to me?’ But Jesus, answering, said to him, ‘Allow it at this time; for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.’* Then he allowed Him.” — Matthew 3:13–15 (NASB 2020)

Michael’s eyes widened. “So baptism is for people like us—to show we’ve been forgiven and want to obey God?”

Papa nodded. “Exactly. Baptism doesn’t wash away sin. Only Jesus’ death and resurrection do that. But baptism is the sign that we belong to Him—and the very first step of obedience after we’ve trusted Him.”

### Scene 5 – The Gentle Voice

They sat on the grassy bank, the lanterns resting beside them. Papa opened the map and pointed to the next verse:

> “Then the LORD came and stood, and called as at other times: ‘Samuel! Samuel!’ And Samuel said, ‘Speak, for Your servant is listening.’” — 1 Samuel 3:10 (NASB 2020)

“Samuel,” Papa said with a grin, “you share a name with the boy who heard God’s voice in the night and obeyed.”

He turned to Michael. “And Elijah learned that God’s voice is often gentle—a whisper that calls for our attention.”

Papa read:

> “And after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire a sound of a gentle blowing.” — 1 Kings 19:12 (NASB 2020)

“Sometimes God’s voice isn’t loud like thunder—it’s soft, like a whisper. But even whispers are powerful when they come from Him. Today, God speaks to us through His Word and by His Spirit in our hearts. Baptism is one way of saying, ‘Lord, I hear You—and I will follow.’”

Michael and Samuel exchanged a look, both grinning. Abi leaned forward. “So baptism is obeying the whisper?”

Papa nodded. “Yes—and just like Jesus, it pleases the Father.”

### Scene 6 – The Step of Obedience

The Crew crossed the bridge together, their lanterns swaying. On the far side, Papa stopped and unrolled the final verse for the day:

> “After He was baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and coming down on Him. And behold, a voice from the heavens said, ‘This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.’” — Matthew 3:16–17 (NASB 2020)

“When you’re baptized,” Papa said softly, “it’s like the Father is smiling over you—not because water saves you, but because you’re choosing to obey Him from the heart.”

From the meadow, Reagan skipped back holding a handful of flowers. “So, it is our way of saying, ‘I’m with Jesus forever.’”

“Exactly,” Papa said. “It’s the start of a lifetime of following Him—through smooth meadows and narrow paths alike.”

The river’s sound faded as they walked deeper into the woods, the lantern light warm against the growing shadows. Ahead, the path curved again, hinting at another clue waiting just beyond.

## SD Crew and Family Prayer time

“Lord, thank You for showing me the way through Jesus’ example. Help me hear Your voice, obey quickly, and live in a way that pleases You.”

## The SD Crew Thought for the day

When you follow Jesus in baptism, you are saying to the world, *“I belong to Him—and I will follow wherever He leads.”*
