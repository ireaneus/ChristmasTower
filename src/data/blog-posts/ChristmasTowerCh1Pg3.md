The tower stood silently sharing Jacob’s grief. It watched as Jacob buried Rachel near Bethlehem, setting up a memorial stone to mark her resting place (Genesis 35:19–20, ESV). Yet, even in this moment of sadness, something greater was unfolding—God’s perfect plan was quietly at work. Though Jacob couldn’t yet see it, the tower seemed to stand as a silent promise that joy would one day come from this sorrow. Many years later, in these same fields, the tower would witness another birth—one that would bring hope and salvation to the whole world.
