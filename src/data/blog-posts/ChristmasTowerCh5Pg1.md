![Mary Joseph Tower](/ChristmasTower/images/MaryJosephTower.webp)

The Roman Emperor ordered a census, and families everywhere returned to their hometowns. Among them were Joseph, a carpenter, and Mary, who was expecting a very special child.

They traveled the dusty roads toward Bethlehem Ephrathah, the place where Rachel had died. The evening sun cast a golden light over the hills. Mary sat quietly on a donkey, her hands resting on her child inside, while Joseph guided their way with care.

As they neared Bethlehem, Joseph looked up at the old Tower of the Flock. Its weathered stones stood firm on the hillside, blending into the land as if it had always been there. Something about the tower gave him hope. He gently squeezed Mary’s hand, remembering the angel’s words: *“Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take Mary as your wife. The child she carries is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you will name Him Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins”* **(Matthew 1:20–21, ESV)**.
