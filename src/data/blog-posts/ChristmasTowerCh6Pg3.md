## Chapter 6 – The Birth of Christ  

That night, under the shadow of the ancient tower, Mary gave birth to her son. She wrapped Him in **swaddling cloths** and laid Him in a **manger** filled with straw. Outside, the fields were quiet except for the gentle rustle of sheep and the occasional murmur of shepherds keeping watch.  

This was no ordinary child. He was **God’s promised Redeemer**—the Lamb of God who would one day take away the sins of the world. Though the world outside slept, unaware of what had just taken place, the tower stood watch, guarding the holy moment as if knowing God’s greatest promise had now been fulfilled.
