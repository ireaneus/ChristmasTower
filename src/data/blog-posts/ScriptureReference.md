## Witnessing

### 2 Corinthians 2:15-16

> For we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing:  
> 16 to the one an aroma from death to death, to the other an aroma from life to life.  
> And who is adequate for these things?

### John 16:8-11

> And He, when He comes, will convict the world regarding sin, and righteousness, and judgment:  
> 9 regarding sin, because they do not believe in Me;  
> 10 and regarding righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you no longer are going to see Me;  
> 11 and regarding judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.

[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### 2 Corinthians 4:18

> while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen;  
> for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.

### Romans 8:24–25

> for who hopes for what he already sees?

---

## Sovereignty

[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Proverbs 16:9

> The heart of man plans his way, but the Lord establishes his steps.

The Bible frequently emphasizes that Jesus is both Savior and Lord, and the two titles are often closely linked to underscore His role in salvation and authority over believers. Here are key verses that highlight this relationship:

1. **Acts 2:36**  
   > Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.
   - This verse identifies Jesus as both the Messiah (Savior) and Lord.

2. **Romans 10:9**  
   > If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.
   - Salvation is tied to confessing Jesus as Lord.

3. **Philippians 2:10-11**  
   > That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
   - Jesus is recognized as Lord universally.

4. **Titus 2:13**  
   > Looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.
   - Jesus is referred to as both God and Savior.

5. **2 Peter 1:11**  
   > For so an entrance will be supplied to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
   - The phrase "Lord and Savior" is used together here.

These verses reinforce the biblical truth that Jesus is not just our Savior, but also our Lord, to whom we owe submission and obedience. His saving grace and sovereign lordship are inseparable in the Christian faith.

## Spirit-Filled, Living by Faith

[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Psalm 33:20-22

> Our soul waits for the LORD;  
> He is our help and our shield.  
> For our heart rejoices in Him,  
> Because we trust in His holy name.  
> Let Your favor, LORD, be upon us,  
> Just as we have waited for You.

### Comparison with Other Scriptures on Trusting and Waiting on God

Psalm 33:20-22 teaches us about waiting on the Lord, trusting in His name, and experiencing His steadfast love. These themes appear throughout Scripture, reinforcing the call to rely on God’s sovereignty and faithfulness.

## Trusting God as Our Help and Shield

[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Psalm 18:2

> The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my Savior, My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge; My shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.

Like Psalm 33:20, this verse describes God as both a shield (protector) and a place of refuge.

**Application:** When we face trials, we must take active refuge in God, not just acknowledge Him from a distance.

### Proverbs 30:5

> Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.

This verse reinforces that God’s shielding protection is tied to trusting in His Word.

## Waiting on the Lord with Expectation

[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Isaiah 40:31

> Yet those who wait for the Lord Will gain new strength; They will mount up with wings like eagles, They will run and not get tired, They will walk and not become weary.

The Hebrew word for "wait" (*qavah*) means to hope with expectation. Those who wait on God are renewed in strength, just as Psalm 33:20 declares that He is our help.

### Lamentations 3:25-26

> The Lord is good to those who wait for Him, To the person who seeks Him. It is good to wait quietly For the salvation of the Lord.

Similar to Psalm 33:22, this passage connects waiting with receiving God’s goodness.

## Rejoicing in God Because of Trust

[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Philippians 4:4-7

> Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice! Let your gentle spirit be known to all people. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and pleading with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.

Like Psalm 33:21, joy comes from trusting God, not circumstances. **Peace comes when we trust instead of being anxious.**

## The Relationship Between God's Favor and Waiting

[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Psalm 5:12

> For You bless the righteous person, Lord, You surround him with favor as with a shield.

Like Psalm 33:22, God’s favor is linked to trust and obedience.

### Psalm 37:7-9

> Rest in the Lord and wait patiently for Him; Do not get upset because of one who is successful in his way, Because of the person who carries out wicked schemes. Cease from anger and abandon wrath; Do not get upset; it leads only to evildoing. For evildoers will be eliminated, But those who wait for the Lord, they will inherit the land.

Patience in waiting leads to blessing, just as Psalm 33:22 says, “Let Your favor be upon us, just as we have waited for You.”

## Connection to Psalm 46:10 ("Be Still and Know That I Am God")

[↑ Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Psalm 46:10 calls believers to **be still and recognize God’s sovereignty.** Psalm 33:20-22 shows how this plays out: **we wait, trust, and rejoice in God’s name.**

---

### Key Takeaways

- **Trust in God’s Sovereignty:** He is our help and shield.
- **Waiting is Active:** It involves expectation and faith.
- **Joy Comes from Trusting Him:** Not circumstances.
- **God’s Favor is Upon Those Who Wait:** His steadfast love never fails.

---

## Final Reflection

Psalm 33:20-22 is a powerful reminder that waiting on the Lord is **not passive**—it is an active trust in God’s sovereignty, leading to joy, protection, and His favor. Other passages throughout Scripture confirm this, showing that **trust, patience, and faith bring strength and blessing.**
