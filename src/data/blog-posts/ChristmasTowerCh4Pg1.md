## Chapter 4 – The Levitical Shepherds  

As the years passed, the fields near *Migdal Eder* took on even greater importance. These fields were now tended by **Levitical shepherds**—priests chosen for a sacred responsibility.  

They weren’t ordinary caretakers of sheep. Their task was holy: to raise lambs that would be offered as sacrifices in the Temple of Jerusalem. The lambs born in these fields had to be without blemish—completely perfect—because they would be used for the most important offerings, including the **Passover lamb**, reminding Israel of how God had rescued them from Egypt.
