     <p>My name is <strong>Dave Haines</strong>, and I am a follower of Jesus Christ, committed to the authority of Godâ€™s Word and the glory of His name. I hold firmly to a Reformed understanding of doctrine, rooted in the historic truths of the Christian faith, and centered on the redemptive work of Christ.</p>

      <p>My journey has been shaped by a deep love for Jesus our King, a desire to see lives transformed by the gospel, and a calling to faithfully proclaim biblical truth. I affirm the supremacy of Christ in all things and embrace the historic confessions that reflect the unity and clarity of the Christian witness throughout the ages.</p>

      <p>This <a href="/LivingWaters/blog/personal-statement">personal statement of faith</a> reflects what I believe about God, humanity, salvation, and the church. It is written not only as a doctrinal affirmation, but as a testimony to the grace of God that continues to shape my life and service in His Kingdom. Soli Deo Gloria!</p>
