**Jeremiah 2:13 (NASB 2020)** says:

> “For My people have committed two evils:
> They have abandoned Me,
> The fountain of living waters,
> To carve out for themselves cisterns,
> Broken cisterns
> That do not hold water.”

## **Spiritual Meaning of Jeremiah 2:13**

This verse carries deep spiritual symbolism, drawing from everyday images in the ancient world to express a profound truth about humanity's relationship with God.

### 🕊 **1. "They have abandoned Me, the fountain of living waters"**

* **God is the source of life, joy, truth, and spiritual satisfaction.** He describes Himself as a *fountain*—a flowing, ever-fresh, life-giving source.
* Spiritually, this reflects God's desire to sustain His people with His presence, His Word, and His Spirit.
* Abandoning the fountain symbolizes turning away from a vibrant, relational trust in God.

**Cross-reference**:  
> *“Therefore you will joyously draw water"*  
> *"From the springs of salvation.”* (Isaiah 12:3)
>
> *Jesus said... "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. 38The one who believes in Me, as the Scripture said,  
> ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’”* (John 7:38)

### 🪨 **2. "To carve out for themselves cisterns"**

* A **cistern** was a man-made pit for storing rainwater—static, stale, and easily contaminated compared to a flowing spring.
* Spiritually, this represents people **replacing God with their own solutions**—human effort, idols, false religions, or worldly philosophies.
* These are *self-sourced*, not God-sourced.

> **Application**: Any attempt to find identity, security, or hope apart from God is like carving a cistern—it might look useful, but it can't give life.

### 💔 **3. "Broken cisterns that do not hold water"**

* Not only are these cisterns man-made, they’re **broken**. They can’t even hold the little water they were supposed to store.
* **Spiritually**, this is the tragedy of sin and idolatry: they promise fulfillment but leave us dry, empty, and broken.
* It's a warning: *what you turn to instead of God will ultimately fail you.*

### 🌿 **Summary (Spiritual Lesson)**

Jeremiah 2:13 is God’s loving lament that His people:

1. **Rejected the true source of life** (Himself),
2. **Chose substitutes that can never satisfy** (idols, sin, self-reliance).

It calls us to:

* Return to **God as our Source**, our Spring of Living Water.
* Reject any false sources of comfort, identity, or purpose.
* Recognize that **only in Christ** can our thirst be truly quenched (John 4:14).
