## Day 3 for the SD Crew – Levi learns to trust

### Scene 7 – The Old Bridge

The Crew followed the trail as it wound deeper into the woods. The river grew wider here, rushing swiftly over hidden rocks. A narrow wooden bridge stretched across the water, old boards creaking under the weight of years.

Levi stepped forward first, squinting at the cracked planks. “I don’t know if this will hold all of us,” he said, giving one of the boards a sharp kick with his boot. The wood groaned, and Charlie gasped.

Abi touched Levi’s arm gently. “Papa’s map led us here. Maybe we should trust it.”

Levi frowned. “I just don’t want anyone to fall in. Shouldn’t we test it first?”

Papa walked up beside him, resting a hand on his shoulder. “That’s wise to be careful, Levi. But sometimes, trusting God means stepping out when it feels risky.”

### Scene 8 – The Promise

Papa unrolled the map and read aloud:

> “Trust in the LORD with all your heart And do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He will make your paths straight.” — Proverbs 3:5–6 (NASB 2020)

Levi’s brow furrowed. “So… it’s not about me figuring everything out?”

“Exactly,” Papa said. “You see, trusting God isn’t about ignoring danger—it’s about knowing His promises are stronger than your fears. This bridge may look weak, but if God has led us here, He will carry us across.”

Samuel nodded firmly. “It’s like when we chose the narrow path yesterday—it wasn’t the easy way, but it was the right one.”

Michael stepped forward, lantern raised. “I’ll go first. God’s Word is our light, right?”

The planks creaked, but they held. One by one, the Crew followed. Levi hesitated, then glanced at Abi, who smiled and held out her hand. Together they stepped onto the bridge.

### Scene 9 – The Lesson

Halfway across, Levi whispered, “It’s holding… maybe I was too worried.”

Papa, close behind, smiled. “It’s good to think carefully, Levi. But remember—faith means trusting God more than your own understanding. He is the One who makes our path secure.”

On the far side of the bridge, the Crew gathered under the shade of tall pines. Reagan bounded ahead to chase a butterfly, while Charlie laughed and toddled after her. Grammy smiled softly, her arms full of wildflowers Reagan had gathered earlier.

Papa rolled up the map and tucked it away. “Every step we take is a reminder—God’s Word is trustworthy. When we lean on Him, He will not let us fall.”

## SD Crew and Family Prayer time

“Lord, help me trust You with all my heart. When I’m afraid or unsure, remind me that Your promises are stronger than my fears.”

## The SD Crew Thought for the day

Faith means trusting God’s promises—even when the bridge looks shaky.
