## Read: 1 Corinthians 3:1–22

Yes, I finally get to talk about one of my favorite Petra songs, *"Fool’s Gold."* I didn’t think it would come up because the context of this scripture is talking about heavenly treasure. But then I saw it: verse 18— *"If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, he must become foolish, so that he may become wise."*

Before quoting the song (even though it’s stuck in my head now), let’s address the real reason for this devotion: fine gold.

Have you seen the TV show Gold Rush on Discovery? It showcases miners using various methods to extract gold from the earth. They design their machines to catch as much fine gold as possible, and along the way, they find small nuggets. At the end, they weigh the gold, and most of it is fine particles. Occasionally, they find nuggets, but it’s rare.

This process parallels our spiritual lives. We labor tirelessly, planting seeds and watering them, often not knowing what kind of harvest we will see. As Paul reminds us in **1 Corinthians 3:6–7**, *"I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth. So then, neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who causes the growth."*

### The “Pay Dirt” of Ministry

During our ministry, God has given us countless opportunities to interact with others. In March 2023, we encountered a family stranded in an airport. Right there in the terminal, we prayed for them. Imagine the crowd around us, one person even commented, “How cool it is to see you pray for them.”

Other encounters followed: a single mom who lost a job, a man in pain after visiting the doctor, and many others. Each moment felt small in the grand scheme, but these are our fine gold moments.

This reminds me of Jesus’ words in **John 4:35–36:** *"Do you not say, ‘There are still four months, and then comes the harvest’? Behold, I tell you, raise your eyes and observe the fields, that they are white for harvest. The one who reaps is receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life, so that the one who sows and the one who reaps may rejoice together."*

### Becoming “Fools” for Christ

Returning to **1 Corinthians 3:18**, Paul calls us to reject worldly wisdom for godly wisdom, even if it makes us appear foolish. As Petra’s song *"Fool’s Gold"* reminds us, *"Some may call me foolish, some may call me odd, but I’d rather be a fool in the eyes of man than a fool in the eyes of God."*

We live in a world that values temporary success over eternal treasure. But Jesus warns us in **Matthew 6:19–21**, *"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal; for where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."*

### Building with Fireproof Materials

Paul also challenges us in **1 Corinthians 3:12–15:** *"Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw, each one’s work will become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each one’s work. If anyone’s work which he has built on it remains, he will receive a reward; if anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, yet only so as through fire."*

This fire represents God’s judgment at the Bema Seat. Here, believers’ works will be tested—not for salvation, but for reward. As Paul describes in **2 Corinthians 5:10**, *"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive compensation for his deeds done through the body, in accordance with what he has done, whether good or bad."*

The fine gold we find through our faithful labor will endure through this test.

### Sowing, Watering, and Harvesting

Our calling is to be sowers, waterers, and reapers. As Paul writes in **Galatians 6:9**, *"Let’s not become discouraged in doing good, for in due time we will reap, if we do not become weary."*

Like the miners on Gold Rush, we sift through tons of dirt for tiny ounces of gold. Every prayer, conversation, and act of love may seem small, but in God’s economy, these moments are eternal treasures.

## Closing Thoughts

The world offers plenty of *“fool’s gold”*—shiny distractions that promise fulfillment but lead to emptiness. As believers, our goal is to sift through the dirt of life, finding the fine gold of eternal significance.

Let’s labor faithfully, keeping our eyes on the true treasure. As Jesus reminds us in **Matthew 9:37–38**, *"The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore, plead with the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest."*

So, let us dig deep, sift carefully, and rejoice in every glimmer of fine gold that God brings our way.
