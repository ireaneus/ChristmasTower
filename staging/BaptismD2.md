## Day 2 for the SD Crew – Michael and Samuel follow Jesus

### Scene 4 – The River Crossing

The narrow path twisted deeper into the woods until the sound of rushing water grew louder. The trees opened to reveal a clear, wide river, sunlight flashing across its ripples. A narrow wooden footbridge spanned the slowest part of the current.

Papa stopped and looked back at the Crew. “Before we cross, I want to tell you about a time Jesus stood by a river.”

Michael tilted his head. “The Jordan River?”

Papa smiled. “Exactly. Jesus came to the Jordan to be baptized by John. He didn’t need to repent—He had never sinned. But He did it to obey the Father and to show us the way.”

Samuel’s eyes lit up. “Like when we get baptized—to show we belong to Him?”

“Just like that,” Papa nodded. “Baptism is the first public step after we choose to follow Jesus.”

### Scene 5 – The Gentle Voice

They sat on the grassy bank, the lanterns resting beside them. Papa opened the map and pointed to the next verse:

> “Speak, LORD, for Your servant is listening.” — 1 Samuel 3:10 (ESV)

“Samuel,” Papa said with a grin, “you share a name with the boy who heard God’s voice in the night and obeyed.”

He turned to Michael. “And Elijah learned that God’s voice is often gentle—a whisper that calls for our attention.”

Papa read:

> “And after the fire the sound of a low whisper.” — 1 Kings 19:12 (ESV)

“Today, God speaks to us through His Word and the Spirit in our hearts. Baptism is our way of saying, ‘Lord, I hear You—and I will follow.’”

Michael and Samuel exchanged a look, both grinning. Abi leaned forward. “So baptism is obeying the whisper?”

Papa nodded. “Yes—and just like Jesus, it pleases the Father.”

### Scene 6 – The Step of Obedience

The Crew crossed the bridge together, their lanterns swaying. On the far side, Papa stopped and unrolled the final verse for the day:

> “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.” — Matthew 3:17 (ESV)

“When you’re baptized,” Papa said softly, “it’s like the Father is smiling over you—not because water saves you, but because you’re choosing to obey Him from the heart.”

Reagan squeezed Charlie’s hand. “So it’s our way of saying, ‘I’m with Jesus forever.’”

“Exactly,” Papa said. “It’s the start of a lifetime of following Him—through smooth meadows and narrow paths alike.”

The river’s sound faded as they walked deeper into the woods, the lantern light warm against the growing shadows.

## SD Crew and Family Prayer time

“Lord, thank You for showing me the way through Jesus’ example. Help me hear Your voice, obey quickly, and live in a way that pleases You.”

## The SD Crew Thought for the day

When you follow Jesus in baptism, you are saying to the world, *“I belong to Him—and I will follow wherever He leads.”*
