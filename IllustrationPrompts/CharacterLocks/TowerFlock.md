# Locked Illustration Prompt — Tower of the Flock (Corrected Wiremap)

**Style:** Realistic, soft, warm natural tones; hand-painted storybook with gentle depth and natural lighting.

## Fixed Object — Tower of the Flock (Object Lock)

* **Base (Square, built into hill):** rough-hewn stone, subtly recessed into the slope.

  * **Entrance:** one (1) **small natural stone opening** on the hillside face; no lintel ornamentation; height ≈ **0.35×** tower diameter; width ≈ **0.25×** tower diameter.
* **Tower (Round, slender):** rises directly from the square base; weathered stone.

  * **Proportions:** overall height ≈ **6.5–7.0×** tower exterior diameter; base height ≈ **0.9×** tower diameter.
* **Windows:** **2–3 narrow slit windows** in the **upper third** of the round shaft; each slit height ≈ **0.12×** tower diameter; evenly spaced around the circumference (only those on the camera side visible).
* **Stone Texture:** varied earth-tone grays/browns; irregular block sizes; softened edges from age; subtle lichen.

> **Never include:** exterior staircases, balconies, ramparts, battlements, upper-level doors, wood galleries, or freestanding platforms.

## Surrounding Hill & Valley (Environment Lock)

* **Hillside:** gentle slope with **long yellow grass** and **scattered small rocks** (fist-to-football size).
* **Paths:**

  * **Shepherd’s path** (foreground-to-tower): narrow, rocky, **S-curve** that **terminates at the base entrance**.
  * **Valley path** (midground): wider, smoother **winding road** that continues toward Bethlehem in the distance.
* **Background:** rolling hills; slightly desaturated to keep the tower dominant.
* **Light/Atmosphere:** calm morning or late-day warm light; soft shadows; dry Mediterranean air clarity.

## Wiremapping Anchors (to Prevent Drift)

1. **Geometry lock:** base **always square** and embedded; tower **always round** and **directly on the base**.
2. **Entrance lock:** **single** entrance **only** at the base on the hillside face.
3. **No flats:** tower **never** stands on a flat plane; it must **emerge from the hillside**.
4. **Window lock:** windows **only** as narrow slits in the **upper third**; count 2–3.
5. **Environment lock:** long **yellow grass + scattered rocks + winding paths** are **always present**.
6. **No added structures:** **no fences, sheds, walls, animals, or people** unless explicitly requested.
7. **Stone palette lock:** earth-tone gray/brown only; **no colored plaster** or painted bands.

## Composition Anchors (Screen-Space)

* **Canvas:** landscape (approx. 16:9).
* **Tower placement:** tower vertical axis sits at **35–45%** of canvas width from the **right edge**; tower top reaches **8–12%** below top edge.
* **Entrance position:** entrance center falls **10–18%** above bottom edge, horizontally aligned with the tower axis.
* **Shepherd’s path:** starts **lower-right quadrant**, curves **left-to-up** into the entrance.
* **Valley path:** midground, **left-to-right** sweep, never intersects the entrance.

## Allowed Variables (Safe to Change per Scene)

* Time of day (within warm, natural light range), weather **without obscuring** tower geometry, cloud density, minor grass variation, camera focal length (35–70mm equivalent), micro-rock scatter.

## Negative Constraints (Hard No’s)

* No snow, no heavy fog obscuring tower profile, no ivy cover hiding the entrance, no banners/flags, no torches, no livestock/people unless specified, no fantasy embellishments (buttresses, crenellations).
