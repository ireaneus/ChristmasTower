# üé® Character Lock: Papa v2.1

**Style**
Classic Disney-style 2D animation with a touch of realism: rich hand‚Äëpainted colors, clean outlines, expressive eyes, warm background tones, and soft lighting.

**Likeness Reference**
Use **`Papa.svg` and `Papa-face.svg`** as the locked likeness references. Preserve the exact face shape/proportions, **hair style & color**, **goatee/mustache shape & placement**, skin tone, height, and body proportions. **If any default conflicts arise (e.g., red hair or full beard), override to match `Papa-face.svg` exactly.** His likeness must remain consistent across all illustrations.
