# Duo Character Lock — BRITT + ABI (Exact Likeness & Staging)

**Pairing Purpose:** Ground every Britt–Abi scene in a warm, mentoring relationship (guardian listening posture + child processing posture).  
**Primary Art References:**  

- Britt: `/SolaDeo/images/Britt-disney.svg`, `/SolaDeo/images/AbiBritt.svg`, `/SolaDeo/images/AbiBrittPhoto.svg`  
- Abi: `/SolaDeo/images/Abi-disney.webp` and **Abi.md** (use the latest lock: pink cap worn **backwards**, pink shirt, height per lock)

## 1) Relative Scale & Placement (lock)

- **Height (standing):** Britt > Abi. Britt’s eye line sits **~1.25× Abi’s head-height** above Abi’s eye line.  
- **Seated on porch steps:** Britt’s head remains **~8–10% taller** in frame (do not equalize).  
- **Spacing:** Maintain **0.4–0.8× Abi’s shoulder width** between them when seated; **0.8–1.2×** when standing side-by-side.  
- **Stance:**  
  - **Britt:** Slight inward angle toward Abi (5–10°), torso relaxed, shoulders level.  
  - **Abi:** Shoulders angled toward Britt, chin slightly raised when listening.

> **Never flip their positions** without purpose. Default layout: **Britt on viewer-left, Abi on viewer-right** for porch scenes; may invert on trails if leading left-to-right.

## 2) Signature Poses (lock)

**Listening Scene (porch/steps):**  

- **Britt:** Seated one step higher or same step, slight lean-in, **hands loosely clasped** or one hand resting on knee; **necklace visible** (must render). Expression: soft smile, attentive eyes.  
- **Abi:** Seated with hands around a flower, book, or lantern handle; sneaker toes angled inward; **cap worn backwards** (brim behind). Expression: thoughtful / curious.

**Walking Scene (farm lane/trail):**  

- **Britt:** Half-step behind Abi; gaze on Abi; relaxed arm swing.  
- **Abi:** Half-step ahead; head turned back toward Britt; lantern or map held mid-torso.

**Prayer Scene (evening):**  

- **Britt:** Hands gently folded; necklace catching a soft rim light.  
- **Abi:** Hands together at chest; cap still backwards; eyes closed or half-lidded.

---

## 3) Wardrobe & Permanents (lock)

- **Britt:** Simple top (neutral cream/white), olive/green pants, practical shoes. **Necklace is permanent** (always present). No outercoat. No hat/scarf.  
- **Abi:** **Pink baseball cap worn backwards** (locked), **pink shirt** (per Abi.md), appropriate bottoms per lock; light jacket only if scene weather requires (do not cover cap).  
- **Color Discipline:**  
  - Britt palette: olives/earth neutrals.  
  - Abi palette: pink accent (cap/shirt) + neutrals.  
  - Avoid high-sat clashing tones; keep harmony warm and soft.

---

## 4) Hair, Face, and Eyes (lock)

- **Britt:** Medium-dark brown hair with warm highlights; warm tan skin (`#e8a25c`~`#e69f59`); warm brown eyes.  
- **Abi:** Keep **Abi.md** skin tone and facial geometry; preserve eye shape; respect height relative to Levi (don’t scale Abi taller than her lock).  
- **No changes** to eye color, facial geometry, or hair parting for either.

---

## 5) Camera & Framing (lock)

- **Porch 3/4 medium shot** (primary): Waist-up both; slight over-the-shoulder bias from Britt to Abi.  
- **Eye-level or –5° tilt** for intimacy; avoid high angles that minimize Abi or low angles that overpower Britt.  
- **Depth:** Keep a soft foreground porch rail or step edge; background gently blurred farmhouse siding or yard.  
- **Rule of Thirds:** Britt’s face near left third intersection; Abi near right third.

**Aspect Variants (deliverables):**  

- **16:9 banner:** 2560×1440 (safe face zone: center 60%).  
- **4:5 portrait (print/social):** 2000×2500 (faces top 40%).  
- **1:1 thumbnail:** 1200×1200 (ensure necklace & cap remain readable).  
- **Web smalls:** 300px wide rounded-corner crops for bios; faces must remain crisp.

---

## 6) Lighting & Mood (lock)

- **Golden-hour warm** for porch; soft direction from camera-left; subtle bounce to preserve skin warmth.  
- **Evening prayer:** One key lantern at 3200–3500K feel; necklace catches a gentle highlight; no harsh speculars.  
- **Do not** use high-contrast noir lighting; avoid cool hospital whites.

---

## 7) Props & Continuity

- **Britt:** Necklace (always), optional mug/book/lantern strap; props never occlude necklace fully.  
- **Abi:** Lantern, flower(s), map snippet. **Cap backward** with strap visible; brim never forward.  
- **Never swap props** between them mid-sequence within the same scene unless shown passing.

---

## 8) Negative Constraints (hard lock)

- ❌ Do not remove Britt’s necklace.  
- ❌ Do not flip Abi’s cap forward; brim must stay back.  
- ❌ No outercoat for Britt.  
- ❌ No bright/neon palettes; no heavy makeup.  
- ❌ Do not equalize their heights or face sizes in frame.  
- ❌ Don’t crop out Britt’s necklace or Abi’s cap in hero shots.  
- ❌ No pose that reads scolding; keep warmth/gentle authority.

---

## 9) Dialogue & Emotion Beats (writing aide)

- **Britt voice:** Gentle questions first (“What do you think that means?”), then short clarifying truths.  
- **Abi voice:** Honest curiosity (“Is that for me too?”), small confessions, soft gratitude.  
- **End beats:** Visual reassurance—Britt’s hand light on rail/knee; Abi’s grip on lantern/flower easing.
