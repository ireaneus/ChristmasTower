## Scene  

**Left Side (Foreground, Real):**

- Michael kneels in soft green grass on a riverbank clearing.  
- His lantern rests beside him on the grass, faintly glowing.  
- His hands rest on his knees as he gazes to the right in awe, face lit with wonder.  

**Right Side (Vision, Symbolic):**

- A **supernatural sequence** unfolds, blending naturally into the background sky.  
- **Earthquake imagery**: jagged rocks breaking apart in the distance (subtle, not violent).  
- **Fire imagery**: tongues of flame rising, but fading away, leaving no destruction.  
- **Gentle blowing imagery**: soft golden light rays and drifting wind currents flowing gently through trees and grass, wrapping in peace.  
- The **wind/light** should dominate ‚Äî soft, holy, luminous ‚Äî while earthquake and fire are faint, transient.

## Mood & Symbolism

- The vision is not frightening but **holy and peaceful**.  
- The key element is the **gentle blowing** (soft wind + light) as the true presence of the Lord, overshadowing earthquake/fire.  
- Michael‚Äôs reverent, thoughtful expression communicates listening to God‚Äôs whisper.

## Negative Constraints

- Only Michael (no siblings, Papa, or Grammy).  
- No modern objects, no text.  
- Earthquake/fire imagery must not appear chaotic or destructive ‚Äî only symbolic and subdued.  
- Vision is clearly distinct from Michael‚Äôs grounded foreground.
