# 🎨 Illustration Prompt — Forest Lanterns Scene

Classic Disney-style 2D animation with rich hand-painted colors, clean outlines, expressive eyes, and bright morning forest lighting. **All character likeness, clothing, build, and facial details come exclusively from their lock `.md` + `.svg` files.** Scene description must never override character locks.

## Scene
