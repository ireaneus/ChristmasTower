# ðŸŽ¨ Illustration Prompt â€” Farmyard Fence (v3)

**Style**  
Classic Disney-style 2D animation with rich handâ€‘painted colors, clean outlines, expressive eyes, warm background tones, and soft morning lighting. Proportions and likenesses must follow character lock `.md` files exactly.

## Scene

A farmhouse yard in **Cottonwood, Arizona**. A sturdy **wooden fence** runs across the foreground. Warm **early-morning sun** (from camera-left) creates soft rim light on hats and shoulders and highlights the wood grain. Background shows an **Arizona ranch house** and groupings of **pine trees**; no extra people or animals.

**Camera & Framing**: Landscape, eye-level, medium-wide. All three characters in one line at the same ground depth, leaning/standing at the fence.

## Characters (lock to .md files)

- **Papa** â€” use `Papa.md` exactly (face, hair, beard/mustache color, clothing, build, height).  
- **Levi** â€” use `Levi.md` exactly (tousled brown hair or cap per lock, red tee, dark shorts, boots, height/build).  
- **Samuel** â€” use `Samuel.md` exactly (short blond hair, **bright yellow hoodie**, denim jeans, hiking boots, height/build).

> Do not substitute clothing or colors. Do not alter hair or facial features. Use the exact likenesses from the locks.

## Placement & Poses

- **Papa**: Center-left, relaxed, **leaning on the fence** with one forearm; other hand resting casually. Warm, grandfatherly smile.  
- **Levi**: Right of Papa, also **leaning back on the fence**, casual/confident stance, friendly grin.  
- **Samuel**: Left of Papa, **standing at the fence**, thoughtful/curious expression, hands resting on the top rail (or one hand hooked over it).

---

## Height & Build Reinforcement

- **Papa** = tallest (per `Papa.md`, sturdy medium build).  
- **Levi** â‰ˆ 5'2" (same as Grammy/Abi per locks), **taller than Samuel**.  
- **Samuel** â‰ˆ 5'0", a little shorter and slimmer than Levi.

Maintain these relative heights at the **same camera depth** (no perspective tricks or foreshortening).

## Lighting & Color Notes

- Golden morning light from the left; soft shadows to the right.  
- Gentle ambient bounce so eyes read clearly beneath hat brims.  
- Palette stays warm (honey golds, dusty reds, sage greens).

---

## Negative Constraints

- **No Grammy** (Papa, Levi, Samuel only).  
- No extra people, animals, vehicles, or props (no lanterns in this scene).  
- No clothing swaps (Samuel must wear **yellow hoodie + jeans**).  
- No style mixing; keep consistent Disney 2D look.  
- No cropping at ankles or cutting off hats. Faces unobstructed.
