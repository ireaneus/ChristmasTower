## Scene

Papa and the children stand in a bright forest clearing, early morning sunbeams spilling through tall trees. Dew sparkles on the grass and leaves. Birds stir in the branches above. Four small brass lanterns glow warmly in the older kids‚Äô hands, casting golden light that stretches ahead on the narrow trail.

* Camera at child-eye level (slightly below Papa), so faces are visible and expressive.
* Background: tall trees with stronger **bright sunbeams** cutting through mist.
* Foreground lantern glow adds warmth and contrast to the bright forest greens.

* **Bright high-key morning**: strong sunbeams from left side, crisp dew sparkle.
* Lanterns glow with warm golden light, softly illuminating the children‚Äôs faces.
* Balance of bright greens/blues (forest) with warm lantern golds.
* **Subtle symbolism (seen only after close look):**

  * Lantern beams form faint cross-shaped rays in mist ‚Äî not obvious.
  * Abi‚Äôs lantern glow arcs forward, hinting at guiding light without halo.
  * Overlapping lantern beams create a whisper of scriptural-like lines in the mist, perceptible only if studied closely.
