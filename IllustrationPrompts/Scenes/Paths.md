# 🎨 Illustration Prompt — The Narrow Path Scene

**Style**
Classic Disney-style 2D animation with rich hand-painted colors, clean outlines, expressive eyes, and warm morning forest light. **All character likeness, clothing, build, and facial details come exclusively from their lock `.md` + `.svg` files.** Scene description must never override character locks.

## Scene

The children and Papa stand at a fork where the trail splits in two:

* The **left path** is wide and smooth, sloping gently downhill into a **sunlit meadow** where tall grass sways.
* The **right path** is narrow and uneven, twisted with roots and shadowed by towering trees.
  Soft mist lingers at the fork, sunlight filtering in beams from the meadow side.

---

## Camera & Framing

* Viewpoint is **from behind the characters**, their backs in the foreground.
* Foreground: Papa and the children seen from behind.
* Background: the forked trail, with **meadow to the left** and **narrow woods to the right**.
* Camera at shoulder height of the children, slightly below Papa, emphasizing the choice ahead.

## Characters (locked)

* **Papa** — (Papa.md + Papa.svg + Papa-face.svg)

* **Michael** — (Michael.md + Michael.svg)
* **Reagan** — (Reagan.md + Reagan.svg)
* **Charlie** — (Charlie.md + Charlie-toy.svg)

*(Exactly these 5 characters appear. Locks are absolute.)*

## Placement & Actions

* **Papa** stands behind the children, scroll in hand, posture steady.
* **Levi** is front-left, **pointing toward the wide meadow path**.

* **Reagan** is crouched slightly beside **Charlie**, holding his hand, bent to whisper softly to him.
* **Charlie** holds Reagan’s hand, looking curiously at the fork.

## Height References (same camera depth)

* Papa (5’7”) tallest, behind the children.
* Levi (5’2”).
