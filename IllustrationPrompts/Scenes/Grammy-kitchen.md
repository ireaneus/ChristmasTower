# Kitchen Prayer — Strict v3 (4 kids only)

**Style**
Classic Disney‑style 2D animation; rich hand‑painted colors, clean outlines, expressive eyes, warm sunrise lighting. Proportions and likenesses must match the SVG references exactly.

**Cast (EXACTLY 6 people in frame — no more, no less):**

* **Papa** — exact likeness from `PapaPhoto.svg` (squinty smiling blue eyes; short dirty‑blonde/grey hair; dirty‑blonde goatee & mustache; brown cowboy hat; dark grey/black plaid flannel; red bandana; jeans; boots).
* **Grammy** — exact likeness from `GrammyPhoto.svg` (rounded gentle face; warm smile; shoulder‑length silver hair; black cowboy hat; red‑and‑black buffalo plaid; **white bandana with black pattern**; jeans; boots).
* **Levi (13)** — exact likeness from `Levi.svg` (tousled brown hair; **red t‑shirt**; **dark shorts**; hiking boots). Height: 5'2" (same crown height as Grammy/Abi).
* **Abi (12)** — exact likeness from `AbiBritt.svg` (dark ponytail; patterned top; jeans; hiking boots). Height: 5'2" (same as Levi/Grammy).
* **Samuel (13)** — exact likeness from `Samuel.svg` (**bright yellow hoodie**; denim jeans; hiking boots). Height: \~5'0" (same as Michael).
* **Michael (12)** — exact likeness from `Michael.svg` & `Michaelphoto.svg` (**short neatly trimmed blond hair; blue eyes**; **green t‑shirt**; **black shorts**; hiking boots). Height: \~5'0" (same as Samuel).

**Hard Exclusions**

* **Do NOT render Reagan or Charlie.**
* No extra adults/kids/figures in the room, hallway, reflections, or outside the window.
* No clothing color swaps; no hats added/removed unless in the SVG; no hairstyle changes.

**Scene & Blocking**

* **Setting:** Cozy farmhouse kitchen, Cottonwood AZ. Warm sunrise through the window above the sink; golden rim light; rustic wooden table set with cocoa mugs.
* **Action:** Grammy has just set a **canvas picnic bag** on the table; everyone is **holding hands in prayer**. Papa stands **behind the kids**, holding a **rolled leather map tied with twine** in his left hand, smiling warmly.
* **Layout (Camera & Framing):** Medium‑wide, eye‑level, three‑quarter view; all six faces unobstructed. Kids seated across the near side of the table; Papa centered behind them; Grammy at frame‑left by the table. Use an **orthographic/telephoto look** so relative heights remain true (no perspective foreshortening). Feet not needed; keep table and faces the focus.

**Height/Scale Controls**

* Papa (tallest) > Grammy = Levi = Abi (5'2") > Samuel = Michael (≈5'0").
* Keep kids on the **same depth line** so crown heights compare correctly.

**Lighting & Mood**
Soft golden sunlight from window (camera left), gentle bounce fill from room; subtle occlusion; warm, prayerful, intimate mood.

**Count & Consistency Enforcement**

* Render **exactly 6 characters** named above.
* If a 5th child appears, **remove** and recompose.
* Validate: hair color, style, facial shapes, clothing, and accessories match their SVGs **exactly**.
