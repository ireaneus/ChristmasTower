# 🎨 Illustration Prompt — [Scene Title]

**Style**  
Classic Disney-style 2D animation with rich hand-painted colors, clean outlines, expressive eyes. Lighting [describe briefly: e.g., soft morning, bright daylight, warm sunset]. **All likeness and clothing details must come exclusively from character lock `.md` + `.svg` files. Do not override character locks in the scene description.**

---

## Scene

[Describe setting/environment only — e.g., forest clearing, farmhouse kitchen, riverbank. Do not describe character features here.]

---

## Camera & Framing

- [Camera angle/height.]  
- [Background notes: environment, lighting direction.]  
- [Foreground/atmosphere notes.]  

---

## Characters (locked)

- If there is **any conflict** between the scene description and the lock files, the **lock files always override.**  
- No substitutions, “close matches,” or reinterpretations are allowed.  
- The lock files are the **final authority** on all character details.

- **Papa** — (Papa.md + Papa.svg)

- **Samuel** — (Samuel.md + Samuel.svg)  
- **Michael** — (Michael.md + Michael.svg)  
- **Levi** — (Levi.md + Levi.svg)  
- **Abi** — (Abi.md + Abi.svg)
