# Illustration Prompt — Scene 9: A New Light (Porch at Sunset)

## Style

Warm, soft Disney-style 2D animation; rich hand-painted colors; clean outlines; gentle, cinematic lighting; inviting, storybook atmosphere.

## Exact Likeness Locks (must match)

* **Abi** — use `Abi.md` with `Abi.svg` and `AbiBritt.svg` / `AbiBrittPhoto.svg` (keep hat/hair, face, skin tone, outfit exactly as locked).
* **Britt** — use `Britt.md` with `Britt-disney.svg` (golden-brown hair with warm honey highlights; pendant necklace visible; no overcoat).
* **Reagan** — use `Reagan.md` with `Reagan-chick.svg` / `Reagan.svg` (age, height, hair, eyes, outfit exactly as locked; barefoot default ok).
* **Charlie** — use `Charlie.md` with `Charlie-toy.svg` (toddler proportions and hair curl).

## Setting

Quaint farmhouse front porch at golden hour. Weathered wood steps/railing; soft greenery and distant orchard hints beyond. No modern objects.

## Camera & Framing

* **Aspect:** 16:9 landscape (final 4096×2304 px)
* **Shot:** Medium-wide, eye-level slightly low to favor the kids; porch fills foreground/midground; background softly defocused.
* **Composition:** Rule-of-thirds: Abi + Britt left-center on the steps; Reagan entering from right with Charlie just behind/right.

## Character Placement & Action

* **Abi (12)** sits on the porch step, **same height as Britt when standing** (lock consistency). Holding a small bouquet **just received**; gentle, newly-hopeful expression.
* **Britt (34)** seated close, turned slightly toward Abi, warm reassuring smile; simple **pendant necklace** visible.
* **Reagan (4)** mid-skip at the lower right step, hand just released from giving the flowers; bright, innocent smile; **exact hair/eyes/outfit per lock**.
* **Charlie (≈1½)** toddling a half-step behind Reagan on the step/landing, one hand lightly touching the railing for balance; joyful, curious look.

## Lighting (critical)

* **Sunset key light** from back-left, soft golden rim along hair/shoulders and porch edges.
* **Lantern glow**: The lantern is **off-camera** (not visible anywhere), positioned low near the characters’ feet (camera-left). It casts a **subtle, warm fill**:

  * Soft elliptical pool of warm light on the wood near Abi’s knees and Britt’s forearm.
  * Gentle warm bounce on lower faces/hands; keep it faint so sunset remains primary.
  * **Absolutely no lantern or reflections of its glass/hardware in frame.**
* Ambient sky fill cools the background greenery slightly for contrast.

## Props & Details

* Small flower bouquet (from Reagan) in Abi’s hands; a few petals/leaves on the step.
* Optional: faint interior farmhouse glow through window **not brighter than sunset**.
* No additional items (no cups, bags, phones, etc.).

## Expressions & Poses

* **Abi:** soft, contemplative smile; shoulders relax; eyes glancing down at flowers then toward Britt.
* **Britt:** gentle, encouraging smile; posture slightly leaned in, one hand resting on step.
* **Reagan:** playful pride at sharing; motion captured mid-step.
* **Charlie:** delighted curiosity; slight wobble typical of toddler gait.

## Color & Values

* Palette leans warm gold/amber for sunlight; lantern adds a lower-temperature warm accent.
* Keep faces in comfortable mid-tones; preserve readable silhouettes with sunset rim.

## Continuity & Scale

* Abi’s proportions and age read clearly **as twelve** (not younger).
* **Reagan** \~2/3 of older kids’ standing height; **Charlie** smaller again with rounder toddler build.
* Britt’s hair reads **golden-brown** (warm honey highlights) per lock.

## Negative Constraints (must enforce)

* **Do not show the lantern** (no partials: no handle, chimney, reflection, or shadow silhouette).
* No extra characters or animals; no text/labels; no modern props; no mismatched outfits; no lens flares or heavy bloom.

## Delivery

* **Output:** PNG, 4096×2304 (16:9), transparent background not required.
* **Framing safety:** Leave \~3% safe margins for potential cropping.
